2022-10-31 10:54:26.469217,FXStreet,EUR/USD Price Analysis: Bears struggle below the parity level,"EUR/USD remains sidelined, mildly offered, after printing two-week uptrend.

Clear downside break of 21-SMA, one-week-old previous support favor sellers amid downbeat oscillators.

Resistance-turned-support from early October restricts immediate downside.

EUR/USD struggles for clear directions around the mid-0.9900s even as bears keep the reins during Monday’s Asian session. In doing so, the major currency pair seesaws between the 21-SMA and the previous resistance line from October 07.

Given the bearish MACD signals and the downbeat RSI (14), not oversold, the EUR/USD prices are likely to extend the previous day’s downside break of the one-week-old ascending trend line, as well as the 21-SMA.

Hence, EUR/USD sellers could wait for a successful break of the 0.9960 immediate support line, previous resistance, for conviction.

Following that, a downward trajectory towards an upward-sloping trend line from September 27, close to 0.9755, appears more likely. During the fall, the 50% and 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the pair’s September-October downside, near 0.9870 and 0.9790 in that order, will be crucial intermediate levels to watch.

On the flip side, the 21-SMA hurdle surrounding the parity level of 1.0000 guards the EUR/USD pair’s immediate recovery before directing buyers towards the previous weekly resistance line, close to 1.0095 at the latest. It’s worth noting that the monthly high also strengthens the 1.0095 hurdle.

Should the EUR/USD bulls manage to cross the 1.0095 resistance, as well as the 1.0100 threshold, the odds of witnessing a rally towards the previous monthly peak near 1.0200 can’t be ruled out.

Risk appetite notably improved this past week on Wall Street. Dow Jones futures lead the charge, surging 5.89% to the highest since late August. Meanwhile, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 2.62% and 3.32%, respectively. In Europe, the FTSE 100 and DAX 40 gained 1.12% and 4.03%, respectively. Australia’s ASX 200 climbed 1.63%.

Overall, a solid earnings season helped propel sentiment higher this past week. Certain big-tech companies, such as Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet, charged higher. There was some volatility as Meta’s stock fell as much as 25% following dismal earnings. Meanwhile, Caterpillar Inc. saw earnings surprise higher on strong parts demand.

Meanwhile, Fed moderation bets gained traction, cooling the US Dollar. In the week ahead, all eyes turn to the US central bank as it likely delivers another jumbo 75-basis point rate hike on Wednesday. That would bring benchmark lending rates to 4%. More attention will be placed on their guidance going forward as the pace of tightening is seen slowing.

Outside of the Fed, AUD/USD will be eyeing a much less aggressive rate hike from the Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday. This is as the British Pound eyes a potential 75-basis point rate hike from the Bank of England on Thursday. Then, markets will shift focus on US non-farm payrolls data on Friday. Will a slowing labor market offer markets some optimism?

Other notable economic prints include New Zealand’s jobs report for NZD/USD. Chinese manufacturing PMI will reveal how the world’s second-largest economy is faring amid slowing global growth. Earnings season is also still in play, with companies such as Moderna, Uber and Toyota reporting. As such, another busy week is in store.

Market’s remain cautious ahead of the key central bank meetings, data.

Mixed data from Japan, BOJ’s dovish play keeps buyers hopeful unless Fed disappoints markets with less than 0.75% rate hike.

USD/JPY grinds higher past 148.00 during the second consecutive positive day, up 0.45% while retreating from the daily high of 148.26. The yen pair’s latest inaction could be linked to the market’s mixed sentiment, as well as anxiety ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting announcements and the US jobs report for October.

That said, the US 10-year Treasury yields seesaw near 4.00% after snapping the 10-week uptrend by the end of Friday. Also challenging the USD/JPY traders is the mixed moves of the equities as the US equity future prints mild losses even after Dow Jones braces for the biggest monthly jump since 1976.

Earlier in the day, Japan’s Industrial Production came downbeat for September but Retail Sales defended the yen optimists. “Japan's factory output fell in September for the first time in four months as manufacturers grappled with rising raw materials costs and global economic slowdown, and is likely to fall again next month before picking up in November, the government said,” per Reuters.

Elsewhere, news of Macau’s lockdown of a casino resort and fears emanating from Russia underpin the USD/JPY upside, due to the US dollar’s safe-haven status. “Russia, which invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, halted its role in the Black Sea deal on Saturday for an ‘indefinite term’ because it could say it could not ‘guarantee the safety of civilian ships’ traveling under the pact after an attack on its Black Sea fleet,” reported Reuters. On the other hand, the concerns that the Fed might discuss slowing down on the rate hikes from December seem to challenge the pair buyers of late.

It should, however, be noted that the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) hesitance to alter the monetary policy versus the Fed’s hawkish mood keeps the USD/JPY buyers hopeful.

Fed may not pause policy tightening measures till the inflation rate gets halved.

An upbeat Japan’s Retail Sales data has supported yen.

The USD/JPY pair has witnessed a steep fall after failing to sustain above the critical hurdle of 148.00 in the Asian session. The asset has slipped to near the immediate cushion of 147.82 as the US dollar index (DXY) has turned volatile. The DXY has refreshed its day’s low at 110.72 and is expected to display more weakness as the risk-on profile has rebounded firmly.

S&P500 futures are holding their previous week’s gains, which has restricted the DXY bulls to gain traction. Meanwhile, the 10-year US Treasury yields have rebounded firmly to near 4.03% ahead of the monetary policy decision by the Federal Reserve (Fed).

The odds for a 75 basis point (bps) rate hike by the Fed are gaining gradually. As per the CME FedWatch tool, the chances for a third quarter-to-a-percent rate hike stand at 83.7%.

According to the economists’ poll by Reuters, the Fed will announce a fourth consecutive 75 bps rate hike. The report further cited that the central bank should not pause until the inflation rate is scaled down by half.

This week, ISM Manufacturing PMI data will also remain in the spotlight. As per the preliminary estimates, ISM Manufacturing PMI data is seen lower at 50.0 vs. the prior release of 50.9. Also, the ISM New Orders Index will be the crucial catalyst that displays forward demand and is seen significantly higher at 49.1 against the former figure of 47.1.

On the Tokyo front, upbeat Japanese Retail Trade data has also supported yen. The monthly and annual Retail Trade have accelerated to 1.1% and 4.5% vs. the projections of 0.6% and 4.1% respectively. The Larger Retail Sales have soared to 4.1% against the estimates of 3.6%. Apart from that, annual Industrial Production has climbed to 9.8% in comparison to the consensus of 8.7%.","The odds for a 75 basis point (bps) rate hike by the Fed are gaining gradually.

Bears will look for Eurozone recession to take entries but Fed’s favor for slower rate hike may keep buyers hopeful.

EUR/USD struggles for clear directions while trading inside a 20-pip range surrounding 0.9950 during early Monday. In doing so, the major currency pair portrays the market’s anxiety ahead of the key eurozone data and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting announcements.

That said, Friday’s US inflation data teased EUR/USD sellers but the underlying details suggest that there is room for the Fed to discuss easy rate hikes from December onwards, which in turn challenge the pair’s downside moves.

Also, the US 10-year Treasury yields seesaw near 4.00% after snapping the 10-week uptrend by the end of Friday. Additionally testing the EUR/USD traders are the mixed moves of the equities as the US equity future prints mild losses even after Dow Jones braces for the biggest monthly jump since 1976.

Talking above the risk-negative catalysts, news of Macau’s lockdown of a casino resort and fears emanating from Russia gain major attention during a sluggish session. “Russia, which invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, halted its role in the Black Sea deal on Saturday for an ‘indefinite term’ because it could say it could not ‘guarantee the safety of civilian ships’ traveling under the pact after an attack on its Black Sea fleet,” reported Reuters. On the other hand, the concerns that the Fed might discuss slowing down on the rate hikes from December seem to challenge the pair buyers of late.

Looking forward, the first readings of the Eurozone’s third quarter (Q3) Gross Domestic Product, expected to ease to 0.2% versus 0.8% prior, as well as the October month’s HICP, likely to soften to 0.6% MoM compared to 1.2% prior, will be important for immediate directions. The reasons could be linked to the growing fears of economic recession in the bloc, which if confirmed could weigh on the EUR/USD prices.

It should, however, be noted that the Fed’s move will be more important for clear directions as talks over the US central bank’s easing on the further rate increases, currently expected to have 0.75% rate lift, could renew the EUR/USD pair’s upside moves.

Technical analysis

Given the bearish MACD signals and the downbeat RSI (14), not oversold, the EUR/USD prices are likely to extend the previous day’s downside break of the one-week-old ascending trend line, as well as the 21-SMA.

Key Market Dynamics:

Market Driver: The market is driven by the operational efficiencies associated with industrial gas turbines . Gas turbines are more efficient, dependable, and fuel-compatible than steam engines or piston engines. Even under tremendous load, the combustors and burner design in these turbines provide exceptional pollution reduction performance. These features make gas turbines the most efficient combustion systems. In addition, the robust design of industrial gas turbines facilitates low thermal conductivity. These turbines have a thermal barrier coating that helps withstand high temperatures of up to 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit to 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit, thereby increasing efficiency. In addition, gas turbine components are lighter compared to components of other turbines. Such operational benefits are driving the growth of the global industrial gas turbine ignition system market.

Market Challenges: Fluctuation in gasoline prices is one of the major challenges in the market. Fluctuating gasoline product prices pose a major challenge for end-user industries, such as oil and gas. Gasoline prices are increasingly dependent on crude oil prices and the level of gasoline supply relative to the market demand. Gasoline prices increase with a decline in gasoline supply compared with its expected consumption. Any disruption in crude oil supplies or refinery operations can destabilize the prices further. These prices may fluctuate because of seasonal changes in demand as well. This can negatively impact the profitability of end-users and destabilize the demand for gas turbines during the forecast period.

Sexual Wellness Market Dynamics:

Market Drivers

Reproductive health and sexual satisfaction are hot issues for all the right reasons. The government is taking action to promote sex education because of the widespread availability of sexually explicit media. The provision of comprehensive sex education programs, in tandem with other initiatives and schemes, will aid in lowering the rate of transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. This is a key factor expected to boost demand for these goods and services through the 2030 prediction period.

The popularity of sexual wellness goods like lubricants, delay sprays, and vibrators has skyrocketed in the LGBT community thanks to the increased acceptance of the community and the legalization of gay marriages. The United States, Sweden, the Netherlands, and many more European countries have all passed legislative rights for the LGBT people. Legal protections for same-sex marriage and same-sex partnerships are likely to fuel the expansion of the sexual health industry. Due to their ability to protect customers' anonymity and privacy, online retailers have become increasingly popular in the global sexual health industry. Online retailers' ability to offer targeted discounts and doorstep delivery has also contributed to their widespread appeal among today's youth.

The importance of sexual health and its relationship to overall health is becoming increasingly mainstream, prompting the development of numerous educational initiatives. The anonymity of the internet plays a crucial role in this, as it allows users to shop around for things that can make sexual encounters more secure and more pleasurable for both partners. In addition, people are feeling more encouraged to be open and honest with their partners about their sexual needs and preferences because of the emphasis placed on sexual wellbeing in discussions of people's overall social well-being.

Market Restraints

However, most emerging and poor countries do not embrace or encourage the pursuit of sexual pleasure. Because of the stigma attached to discussing one's wants and needs, people often avoid the subject altogether. The population, and especially millennials, are increasingly reliant on unreliable and artificial means of obtaining information due to a combination of a lack of awareness and a decline in the availability of correct sources for this data. During the projection period ending in 2030, these variables are projected to act as obstacles to the smooth functioning of the industry and growth of the market.

COVID-19 Analysis:

The sexual wellness industry is one that stands to gain greatly from the novel coronavirus outbreak, with projections indicating significant growth, expansion, and increased sales volume in the year of the pandemic (2020). Since the epidemic hit, however, most other market companies and industries have remained clueless about how to survive on the backs of market forces of demand and supply. There has been a wide range of effects on this particular market. Ironically, the major background that contributed to a reduction in demand and production capabilities of other industries was the increase in the sexual wellness sector as the lockdown was imposed by global governments.

While there has been a significant increase in demand for condoms, there has been a significant decrease in demand for sex toys and other related things. When it came to fulfilling their sexual desires, many people once turned to sex toys. International recommendations encouraging safe sexual behavior were published by nations as the virus spread and a lockdown was implemented. As a result of the widespread damage caused by the pandemic, several multinational corporations are currently searching for acquisition targets in the sexual wellness market. This sector holds significant development potential for the industry from 2022 to 2030.

By Distribution channel

The drug stores segment is expected to rise at a notable CAGR over the review period.

Sexual Wellness Market Regional Analysis:

North America was the fastest-growing regional market during the previous projection period that concluded in 2019, and similar growth rates are anticipated for the current term. This is due in large part to the fact that businesses catering to the American market have introduced numerous novel sex aids and condoms. As a result of the widespread need for these items, numerous approaches to product advancement have been adopted, all of which should aid in the growth of the sexual wellness industry. The rising number of government programs and non-governmental organization (NGO) efforts to encourage birth control could spur expansion of the industry. The rising number of childbearing women in the United States, along with the convenience of e-commerce, is predicted to boost demand for sexual health products.

More and more people in the Asia-Pacific region are making purchases online because of the convenience and ease with which they may browse a wide variety of products and compare prices. Retailers can benefit from this because there is no need to open new stores. As a result of the convenience of being able to read reviews left by other shoppers, compare prices among sellers, and look up specific product information, internet shopping has become increasingly popular. To add insult to injury, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a surge in online shopping in India. The increasing popularity of e-commerce is a key factor propelling the development of the sexual health industry in India.

2022-10-31 03:54:26.981147,ESPN Sioux Falls,University of South Dakota Football Falls Once Again,"The University of South Dakota football team had a big win last week at D-Days but was unable to continue that momentum on Saturday.

USD lost on the road to Youngstown State on Saturday 45-24 after keeping it close in the first quarter, only trailing 10-7.

From the first quarter on though, Youngstown State pulled away and USD was unable to answer the offensive explosion from YSU.

USD was outscored 28-3 in the second quarter and gave up a total of 451 yards on the afternoon.

With the loss, USD fell to 1-4 in the MVC and 2-6 overall and unfortunately will miss out on the playoffs this year for sure after their latest loss.

Up next, USD will host Missouri State next Saturday at 1 PM in Vermillion.

Here is the complete release from the USD Athletic Department after the loss.

YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio—Youngstown State racked up 451 yards of offense and scored on all six of its first-half possessions in a 45-24 win against South Dakota Saturday at Stambaugh Stadium.

Penguin running back Jaleel McLaughlin, the nation's leading rusher entering the weekend, carried 19 times for 119 yards and two scores. Mitch Davidson passed for 242 yards and three touchdowns. Bryce Oliver caught two of those scores and totaled 122 yards on seven receptions.

South Dakota redshirt freshman Aidan Bouman made his first collegiate start at quarterback, passed for 254 yards and accounted for two touchdowns. He snuck in from 1 yard out and tossed a 4-yard touchdown to Wesley Eliodor in the second half. Eliodor caught four passes for a career-high 70 yards. One of those catches went for 11 yards and setup the Bouman sneak.

It was the second quarter that doomed the Coyotes. After USD kicker Eddie Ogamba booted a 28-yard field goal to tie the game at 10-10, Youngstown State scored 28 unanswered points. The Penguins drove 90 yards and 75 yards on those first two drives, and used a pair of Coyote fumbles for short scores on the last two. In the blink of an eye, it was 38-10.

Bouman's passing total was the second highest by South Dakota this season. He completed 17-of-30 throws and connected on a pair of long balls to Eliodor and tight end JJ Galbreath early in the game. He was also sacked five times and turned it over on a 3rd-and-22 play near midfield that led to Youngstown State's final score of the first half.

Galbreath led South Dakota with 71 yards on three catches that included some nifty moves with the football. Travis Theis ran 12 times for 56 yards including a 15-yard touchdown run in the middle of the first quarter that tied the game at 7-7. But add the sacks in and South Dakota was outgained 200-56 on the ground.

South Dakota (2-6, 1-4 MVFC) fell to 0-6 all-time at Stambaugh Stadum and saw its chance for back-to-back playoff appearances end. Youngstown State (5-3, 3-2) has won three in a row. The Coyotes host Missouri State in a 1 p.m. kick in Vermillion next weekend.

2022-10-31 09:54:26.995847,FXStreet,"USD/CAD stays defensive around 1.3600 amid sluggish oil, focus on US/Canada employment data","USD/CAD braces for the first monthly loss in three.

Oil prices snapped two-week downtrend amid geopolitical concerns.

BOC’s disappointment keeps buyers hopeful as Fed is likely to have a long road before hitting the neutral rate.

US/Canada employment data for October will also be crucial for clear directions, risk of further upside appears high.

USD/CAD struggles to defend 1.3600, retreating from intraday high near 1.3620 during Monday’s initial Asian session, as geopolitical fears underpin oil prices, Canada’s key export. Adding strength to the downside bias is the US dollar’s failure to pick up amid the cautious mood ahead of the key US Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy meeting, up for Wednesday, as well as Friday’s monthly jobs report for the US and Canada.

Recently increasing risks from the Russia-Ukraine tussles appeared to have helped the WTI crude oil to remain firmer above $88.00 after the first weekly gain in three. “Russia, which invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, halted its role in the Black Sea deal on Saturday for an ‘indefinite term’ because it could said it could not ‘guarantee safety of civilian ships’ traveling under the pact after an attack on its Black Sea fleet,” reported Reuters. It should, however, be noted that the fears of recession contrast with the global oil producer’s (OPEC+) accord to cut the output to challenge the energy traders.

Elsewhere, Friday’s strong prints of the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, namely the US Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, coupled with the fifth quarterly fall in the US private consumption, challenged the USD/CAD traders. That said, the stated inflation gauge rose to 5.1% YoY for September versus 5.2% expected and 4.9% prior.

Even so, the Bank of Canada’s (BOC) slower-than-expected rate increase during the latest monetary policy meeting contrasts with the Fed’s likely hawkish performance, before slowing down in December, which should keep the USD/CAD buyers hopeful. Economists at Goldman Sachs raised the Fed rates outlook and saw the peak at 5% in March. On the same line was the CME’s FedWatch Tool which suggests an 80% chance of the Fed’s 75 bps rate hike during Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).

While portraying the mood, the yields are down and the equities are bracing for a good month with Dow Jones bracing the biggest monthly jump since 1976. Further, the S&P 500 Futures remain mildly offered near 3,910 amid the sluggish markets.

Looking forward, Friday’s US/Canada employment report for October will be crucial for the USD/CAD pair as the Fed’s 75 bps rate hike appears already prices. Even so, the hints for a slower rate increase from December could exert downside pressure on the quote.

Technical analysis

Despite bouncing off monthly support near 1.3500, the USD/CAD pair’s upside needs validation from a two-week-old resistance line, currently around 1.3730 by the press time.","Oil prices snapped two-week downtrend amid geopolitical concerns.

Nebulizer Market Drivers and Restraints

Rising Respiratory Disorders to Propel Market Progress

Nebulizers are drug delivery devices that deliver medicines in the form of a mist in the lungs. Rising respiratory disorders are likely to foster the product adoption. For example, as per the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America’s strategy, in April 2022, nearly 25.0 million people in the U.S. suffered from asthma. Poor air quality, rising pollution, and the presence of several factories are expected to foster the demand for the device. Furthermore, rising healthcare costs enhanced the adoption of home healthcare services, thereby elevating the demand for effective medical procedures and equipment. In addition, the robust demand for inhaled drug delivery devices is expected to drive the nebulizer market growth.

However, disease transmission risks and the availability of alternative treatment methods may hamper the market growth.

Regional Insights

Higher Prevalence of Asthma to Propel Market Progress in North America

North America is projected to dominate the nebulizer market share due to the higher prevalence of asthma. The market in North America stood at USD 382.7 million in 2021 and is expected to gain a huge portion of the global market share in the coming years. Furthermore, the higher prevalence of asthma is expected to enhance the demand for medical devices.

In Europe, the increasing prevalence of respiratory diseases and robust adoption of the device is expected to boost industry growth. Further, the rising prevalence of respiratory diseases is expected to enhance market progress.

In Asia Pacific, the increasing prevalence of chronic respiratory disorders is likely to elevate the demand for nebulizers. This factor may propel market progress in the region.

2022-10-31 06:54:27.009718,FXStreet,NZD/USD bulls pressured as US strength shines through ahead of big week,"NZD/USD is pressured by the resurgence of the US dollar.

Key data events will be challenging for the bird.

NZD/USD ended the day a little lower on Friday, losing some 0.26% from the high of 0.5873 and reaching a low of 0.5782. The US dollar firmed into the final days of the week from a significant trendline support as traders get set for a very busy schedule this week that includes the Federal Reserve and US Nonfarm Payrolls as the highlights.

While there is little in the way of domestic risks to start the week, the Reserve Bank of Australia is this week which could have an influence on the bird and there will be NZ jobs also. We also have the Chinese Official PMI (Oct) to start off the week. However, the event risk that is front and centre this week will be the FOMC and whether the board will decide not only a 75bp hike but due to the considerable uncertainty around the degree of hawkishness in the Fed’s guidance, the presser will be key.

''The US PCE deflator may have come in a touch below expectations, but the core inflation is still very elevated,'' analysts at ANZ Bank argued. ''Locally, it’s almost guaranteed that the Q3 labour market statistics (out Wednesday) will clock the labour market at inflationary levels (we estimate the NAIRU is around 4.5%), but as is always the case, the volatile HLFS data is capable of producing a decent miss vs market expectations. Wages will be key, and while the hurdle is high to beat the RBNZ’s forecast (8.3% YoY for the QES), these data will at least confirm how advanced the wage-price spiral has become.''

RBA outlook

As for the RBA, it is expected to raise its cash rate by 25bps, according to 28 out of the 32 respondents polled by Reuters, whilst a handful look for a 50bps increase. Westpahas have been calling for a 50bps increase “in November for a terminal rate of 3.85% by March, revised up from 3.6%.” Analysts at NAB have argued for just a25bps hike. ""In these circumstances, the RBA will need to move monetary policy into a more clearly restrictive territory to ensure inflation returns to target,"" NAB argued.","NZD/USD is pressured by the resurgence of the US dollar.

2022-10-31 09:54:27.020841,FXStreet,Gold Price Forecast: XAU/USD to head lower as Fed set to signal a continued tightening bias – TDS,"“Gold prices are likely to head lower. The Fed will move aggressively on Wednesday and most likely will signal a continued tightening bias. Unless there is some sort of concern over financial stability, the US central bank is unlikely to pivot to a dovish direction. This implies that prices and length should decrease, once family offices and other specs cut exposure in response to rising front-end rates .”

“Despite the price moving higher and markets musing about inflation turning lower in the not too distant future and hoping the US central bank would sharply reduce the pace of tightening, long exposure did not increase one bit. This suggests to us that while traders don’t see rates accelerating much beyond what is currently priced, at the same time they don’t see a dovish tilt anytime soon.”

Money managers aggressively covered their short gold exposure, as talk of a Fed pivot drove rates and the greenback lower. Nevertheless, economists at TD Securities expect the yellow metal to edge lower as the Fed is set to move aggressively this week .

2022-10-31 04:54:27.022959,DRGNews,USD Nursing gets $1-million grant to grow South Dakota nursing workforce,"Two leaders of the University of South Dakota’s Department of Nursing have garnered a substantial grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to increase the number of nurses in rural and underserved areas in South Dakota.

USD Nursing Assistant Professor and Associate Chair Anne Kleinhesselink and Chair Anne Pithan are managing the $1,050,000 million grant, which will be disbursed in increments of $350,000 per year for the next three years.

The South Dakota Department of Labor data shows a clear need for growing the nursing workforce, especially registered nurses. Shortages are expected to grow through 2030, and HRSA projects that by that time, South Dakota will be one of seven states in the U.S. where the demand for registered nurses is greater than the supply.

“Communities across the state are without the resources necessary to support the health care needs of underserved populations in South Dakota and as administrators of this grant, we will meet this need,” explained Pithan. “USD is fully equipped to meet the workforce challenges in the state of South Dakota because we understand those challenges and have the capacity to develop innovative education to strengthen undergraduate nursing student skills to practice in acute care settings. This grant will advance health equity, increase students’ awareness of acute care in underserved communities and prepare them to provide care in these communities.”

With the HRSA grant, USD Nursing will create training models to strengthen skills and work to increase the diversity of the nursing workforce, recruiting students from varied backgrounds, including students from tribal lands and rural areas, who will then go on to practice in South Dakota’s underserved communities spanning the entire state.

“This HRSA grant speaks directly to the mission of USD Nursing to improve the well-being of people, particularly those in rural and underserved communities and to benefit the health care and workforce needs of South Dakota,” explained Kleinhesselink. “The grant will provide students an exciting opportunity to experience health care in rural communities and the impact they can make as a nurse in underserved communities.”

The training developed by USD Nursing will provide students with intensive, real-world experiences and perspective of the nursing role in rural clinical settings, including working with experienced professionals in a variety of departments. The students will gain a better understanding of the complexity of rural nursing to include the unique knowledge and skills necessary for practice; exposure which will also improve recruitment and retention of nurses to underserved areas.

By the end of the grant term, which is September 2025, USD nursing will:

Increase number of USD nursing graduates practicing in acute care settings in underserved communities by 5% annually. Increase the confidence of current and future nurses by developing their leadership, communication, and critical thinking skills. Increase the number of USD nursing students from underserved communities by 5%. Increase the number of Native American nursing students at USD by 5%. Train 24 nursing students annually in acute care settings in underserved communities.

Students participating in the clinical experience at a rural health facility will partner with clinical experts to disseminate what they have learned to the current and future workforce by offering ECHO series to educate on incorporating health equity, culturally sensitive and team based care into practice.","The South Dakota Department of Labor data shows a clear need for growing the nursing workforce, especially registered nurses.

The Singapore Dollar extended its advance against the US Dollar this past week, with USD/SGD touching levels last seen in the middle of September. The pair was unable to hold a breakout under the 1.4107 – 1.4061 inflection zone as the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) held. A confirmatory breakout under the latter could reinforce a bullish prerogative for the Singapore Dollar. That exposes the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at 1.3981 towards the August low.

Philippine Peso Technical Outlook – Bullish

The Philippine Peso some strong gains against the US Dollar this past week. USD/PHP sank 1.44%, marking the best 5-day gain since February 2016. This is offering a bullish bias for PHP. Keep a close eye on the 50-day SMA. It held as support and there is a chance it could maintain the upside focus. Such an outcome places the focus back on October highs. Otherwise, a breakout under the 50-day SMA exposes the 100-day line, which could maintain a broader upside trajectory.

The Thai Baht aimed slightly higher against the US Dollar this past week. Still, progress was rather lackluster. The rising zone of support from August held, maintaining the upside focus. As such, USD/THB may turn higher in the coming days and face the October high once again. The latter sits just under the June 2006 peak at 38.61.

2022-10-31 07:54:27.035633,FXStreet,USD/CHF Price Analysis: Bulls poke 0.9980 resistance confluence,"USD/CHF grinds higher during a three-day uptrend, eyes third consecutive monthly gain.

Convergence of 50-SMA, 100-SMA challenge buyers of late.

MACD, RSI conditions suggest gradual advances toward the yearly low.

USD/CHF buyers jostle with the 0.9975-80 hurdle during the initial hour of Monday morning in Europe. In doing so, the Swiss currency (CHF) pair braces for the third monthly gain as it pokes a joint of the 100-SMA and the 50-SMA.

Given the firmer RSI (14) and the bullish MACD signals, not to forget the pair’s sustained trading beyond a three-day-old ascending trend line, USD/CHF prices are likely to remain firmer.

However, a clear upside break of the 0.9980 hurdle appears necessary for the buyers to meet the 1.0000 psychological magnet.

Following that, multiple hurdles around 1.0080 could probe the USD/CHF pair’s upside ahead of challenging the yearly top of 1.0148. In a case where the quote remains firmer past 1.0150, the April 2019 peak surrounding 1.0240 will gain the market’s attention.

Meanwhile, the pullback move remains elusive unless the quote stays beyond the aforementioned support line from Wednesday, close to 0.9920 at the latest.

Should the USD/CHF bears manage to conquer the 0.9920 support, the 0.9900 threshold and the monthly low near 0.9840 will be on their radar.

Overall, USD/CHF is likely to remain firmer but the upside room appears limited.

MACD, RSI suggest short-term downside but bears need validation from 0.5740 to retake control.

Buyers have a long road to success, 0.5900 challenges short-term upside.

NZD/USD holds lower ground near 0.5800 as bulls take a breather after a two-week uptrend. Even so, the Kiwi pair stays inside a short-term bullish channel, as well as the 200-SMA, to keep the buyers hopeful.

That said, bearish signals from the MACD and the RSI (14) weakness suggest the intraday weakness of the pair. Hence, a convergence of the stated channel’s lower line and the 200-SMA, close to 0.5740 gains major attention.

Before that, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the pair’s September-October downturn, around 0.5760, could entertain the NZD/USD sellers.

In a case where the quote drops below 0.5740, the odds of witnessing a slump toward the yearly low near 0.5515, marked earlier in the month, can’t be ruled out.

Alternatively, recovery moves may initially aim for the monthly high of 0.5870 before testing the bear’s patience by poking the channel’s upper line, close to 0.5900 by the press time.

It should be noted that the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level near 0.5915, also known as the golden ratio, acts as the last defense for the NZD/USD bears before giving control to the buyers targeting the 0.6000 psychological magnet.

2022-10-30 12:54:27.473633,DailyForex,"Weekly Forex Forecast –Gold,BTC","I still believe that signs of exhaustion will be sold into, although if you are trying to take advantage of the US dollar strength against major currencies.

Gold

Gold markets spent the early part of the week trying to rally but have pulled back from the 200-Weekly EMA, as well as the crucial $1680 level, an area that previously had been very important. The fact that we are closing toward the bottom of the candlestick suggests that we may very well be getting ready to test the $1620 level underneath, which is where we formed a short-term double bottom. If we break through there, and I do think we will eventually, it is very likely that gold will plummet down to the $1500 level. Keep an eye on that Federal Reserve press conference late Wednesday for clues.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin has had a slightly positive week, but quite frankly it is still flat on its back. I do not believe that Bitcoin has suddenly found a bottom, and it’s likely that if the Federal Reserve remains hawkish, perhaps even in that press conference on Wednesday, Bitcoin will get eviscerated. The $18,000 level is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and an area where we’ve seen a lot of support previously. If that gets violated, Bitcoin goes much lower. On the other hand, rallies all the way up to the $25,000 level only continue the consolidation that we had been in.

EUR/USD

The EUR/USD has rallied rather significantly during the trading week to pierce the parity level. The European Central Bank had raised interest rates to the 2.00% level, as anticipated. However, it looks as if the market is less than impressed, because after those gains, the very next day we started to see selling pressure and then broke below parity. The resulting candlestick is a bit of a shooting star, and it looks like we are going to continue to drift lower, especially if the Fed remains hawkish.

GBP/USD

The GBP/USD has rallied most of the week, slamming into a major trendline. The 1.16 level is an area where we’ve seen some noise previously, so it will be worth paying attention to. Keep in mind that the British pound had been massively oversold heading into this week, so a continuation of the “bear market rally” me quite a bit of sense. This is especially true after the British change prime ministers, and now look as if they are going to walk back that disastrous budget. Nonetheless, the United Kingdom still has a hard winter ahead of it, so I still believe that signs of exhaustion will be sold into, although if you are trying to take advantage of the US dollar strength against major currencies, you will probably have an easier time doing it against the Euro or the Yen.

S&P 500

The S&P 500 E-mini contract rallied most of the week, as we have approached the 3900 level. At this point, the market will be sitting around and waiting to see what the Federal Reserve has to say on Wednesday, and it looks like everybody is trying to get ahead of Jerome how either suggesting that the Federal Reserve is going to slow down rate hikes, or perhaps even hike rates by only 50 basis points instead of the expected 75. There is a very high probability that Jerome Powell will disappoint the bullish. I suspect by the end of the week, the sellers will come back in, mainly because they have extrapolated the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of Canada raising less than anticipated as a sign of what the Federal Reserve is going to do. Having said that, they completely ignored the ECB and the fact that they did raise as much as anticipated.

WTI Crude Oil

The West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil market rally during the week, albeit from a very oversold condition. Recently, we had seen a surge higher, perhaps due to the OPEC members cutting 2 million barrels per day, but it still looks to me like the markets got some questions asked. If we can break above the highs of 2 weeks ago, then it’s likely this market is much higher, perhaps trying to reach $120 before it’s all said and done. Obviously, the $100 level between here and there would be a fight as well, but a breakout to the upside could be a resumption of the uptrend. On the other hand, if we were to break down below the $80 level, that could send oil much lower.

DAX

The Frankfurt exchange initially pulled back a bit during the trading week, but then turned around to show signs of strength, just as most other stock markets did. At this point, traders are starting to focus on the fact that central banks may slow the rate of interest rate hikes, but quite frankly that’s not a good sign, because it shows that we still have plenty of economic headwinds out there. Yes, it could provide a short-term boost for stocks, but over the longer term, you are still going to see a lot of negative pressure. I anticipate that the DAX may be rather choppy this coming week.

USD/CAD

The US dollar has gone back and forth during the course of the trading week, as the Bank of Canada raised interest rates a little less than anticipated. However, people are trying to extrapolate that because the Canadians did this, clearly the Americans will raise less than anticipated. Regardless, when you look at the weekly chart, I think this is more about the market working off a lot of froth, as we had shot straight up in the air. It appears that we continue to bounce around between the 1.35 level in the 1.40 level. I think this week will probably be more of the same, because the Canadian dollar may be insulated by the oil markets.

Advertisement Heavy swings in the dollar make highly profitable trades Make Your Move Now!

The GBP/USD will enter trading this coming week with a positive dose of speculative fever swaying over its landscape. The U.K government managed not to create a major change of policy in the past week and for the moment the current new leadership actually looks like it may last longer than a month. While that is certainly meant to be sarcastic, it does highlight the rather unbelievable stretch the GBP/USDS has seen the past two months with rather negative media coverage hovering over the U.K government.

The GBP/USD went into the weekend showing it has the ability to sustain its short term higher values near the 1.16100 ratio, this is a far cry from the lower depths challenged in the weeks past. Before traders get completely too ambitious about the GBP/USD they should note the U.K government is not out of the woods yet, and the public will count on the new leadership to deliver solid economic outcomes. Good economic results may remain challenging in Britain and elsewhere over the mid-term.

The GBP/USD has burst higher on the belief it was vastly oversold

However financial institutions within Forex, particularly among the major currency pairs like the GBP/USD are often making long term wagers. Yes, corporations have to execute daily transactions where the value of the forex pair frequently is thought about but not the guiding ‘light’, because invoices need to be paid. Retail traders often must make short term bets, folks with deeper pockets can keep trades on for quite some time.

But financial houses also know what is coming down the road over the next half year and they do tend to position for what they believe will be direction. Speculation while not talked about loudly in financial houses do consistently see banks and investment houses wager on their behavioral sentiment outlooks.

If the GBP/USD can maintain the 1.16000 mark early this week and show that buyers remain in the trading waters, this could spark speculative intrigue which causes the currency pair to continue challenge highs again seen last week.

Traders should not be overly ambitious, because fundamental concerns remain, and the U.K has plenty of economic clouds on the horizon. If the 1.16500 level comes within sight some traders may see this as too high considering the past week of results.

The coming week of trading for the GBP/USD will likely remain Volatile

Traders need to be ready for a rather turbulent mix of short term positive sentiment and prepare for those who want to continue to point fingers and say the GBP/USD should remain under pressure. The U.K government will try to deliver more calm and has postponed it next large fiscal policy statement until the middle of November, but that could change quickly if politicians combat each other for the microphone.

GBP/USD Weekly Outlook:

Speculative price range for GBP/USD is 1.13990 to 1.18100

Speculators should monitor the GBP/USD carefully. The forex pair has certainly seen a solid dose of buying emerge in the past week and a half. However reversals lower are likely to be seen too as reactions and natural cycles filter in the week’s trading. If the GBP/USD falls below the 1.15800 ratio it could spark some concern among those aiming for higher realms and force additional selling. A move below the 1.15000 level would certainly strike some fears and some traders may believe the 1.14450 would then have to be watched.

Optimistic traders should be careful. While the trend often proves to be the friend of speculators, the golden goose does have to take a break every so often. And this trend up has not been a long one, in fact it really only started on the 21st of October, this after the GBP/USD flirted with the 1.10700 mark briefly. If the GBP/USD can hit the 1.17000 ratio higher, this would be quite an accomplishment, a rise to 1.18000 may raise suspicions things are far too positive however. Traders should be willing to cash in profits if they materialize, and not let them vanish while wagering the GBP/USD is going to produce a sustained climb. It actually might, but the ride is likely to be bumpy short term.

2022-10-31 05:54:27.486660,FXStreet,"EUR/USD Price Analysis: The bulls are in play for the open, but bears ready to pounce","The daily chart shows that while the price has tried to get above the trend, it has yet to breach the resistance zone and the tweezer tops could prove to be the peak of the breakout. A move below 0.9875 will be significant in this regard, putting the price back into line with the dominant trend with prospects of a move below the counter trendline and back into the hands of the bears to target a critical break of 0.9705.

On the other hand, if bulls do not commit thereafter, while below the recent peaks in the 1.0090s, a continuation to 0.9750 could be on the cards into the Federal Reserve:

We have a W-formation in place that could act as a firm support considering the price has moved to the backside of the trendline with accumulation in play.

For the open, EUR/USD is hovering above a void of liquidity towards 0.9870, but if the bulls can hang on above 0.9950 for the start of the week, there will be prospects of a move above 1.0000 with 1.0050 eyed.

The EUR/USD pair has slipped marginally after struggling to cross the immediate hurdle of 0.9965 in the early European session. The asset has turned sideways amid ambiguous performance displayed by the mighty US dollar index (DXY).

The risk profile is displayed mixed response as upbeat S&P500 futures are providing a solid cushion while anxiety ahead of the interest rate decision by the Federal Reserve (Fed) is capping the upside.

2022-10-31 05:54:27.520399,FXStreet,"USD/INR Price News: Indian rupee floats around 82.50, Fed, RBI announcements eyed","USD/INR remains mildly bid while paring the previous weekly losses.

Downbeat China data, risk-off mood propel prices even as WTI crude oil drops.

Hopes of RBI’s inaction join hawkish Fed bets to keep buyers hopeful.

USD/INR picks up bids to consolidate the previous week’s losses around 82.40 during early Monday in Europe. In doing so, the Indian rupee (INR) pair portrays the market’s rush towards the US dollar ahead of the key central bank announcements.

That said, the US Dollar Index (DXY) prints a three-day uptrend around 110.80, up 0.10% intraday by the press time, as traders expect the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to announce a 75 basis point of a rate hike during Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).

On the other hand, Reuters stated that the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy committee meeting on Thursday was most likely to discuss the central bank's response to the government after failing to meet its inflation target for three quarters in a row. “State Bank of India does not expect any other agenda for this meeting, despite being scheduled a day after the Fed meets,” the news also adds.

Elsewhere, the downbeat prints of China’s activity numbers and fears emanating from Russia also weigh on the market’s sentiment and propel the USD/INR prices. China’s official NBS Manufacturing PMI for October dropped to 49.2 versus 50.0 expected and 50.1 prior. Further, the Non-Manufacturing PMI also slumped to 48.7 compared to 51.9 market forecasts and 50.6 previous readings. “China's factory activity unexpectedly fell in October, an official survey showed on Monday, weighed by softening global demand and strict COVID-19 restrictions, which hit production,” said Reuters following the data.

Further, news of Macau’s lockdown of a casino resort and fears emanating from Russia also underpin the USD/INR upside, due to the US dollar’s safe-haven status. “Russia, which invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, halted its role in the Black Sea deal on Saturday for an ‘indefinite term’ because it could say it could not ‘guarantee the safety of civilian ships’ traveling under the pact after an attack on its Black Sea fleet,” reported Reuters.

It should be noted that the recent weakness in the WTI crude oil prices, down 1.0% on a day around $87.40 by the press time, fails to tease the USD/INR bears. That said, the US 10-year Treasury yields seesaw near 4.00% after snapping the 10-week uptrend by the end of Friday while the US equity future prints mild losses even after Dow Jones braces for the biggest monthly jump since 1976.

Moving on, the market’s risk catalysts and second-tier PMI data from the US may entertain the USD/INR pair traders but the bulls are likely to keep the reins.

US yields add to Friday’s rebound and bolster the upside in the dollar.

Investors’ attention will be on the FOMC event due on November 2.

The greenback, in terms of the USD Index (DXY), remains bid and reclaims the area beyond 111.00 the figure at the beginning of the week.

USD Index focuses on Fed

The index advances for the third session in a row on Monday and looks to consolidate the breakout of the key 111.00 barrier on the back of further weakness in the risk complex and another so far positive session in US yields across the curve.

On the latter, yields add to Friday’s upbeat tone and extend the recovery, setting aside at the same time part of last week’s weakness.

Nothing scheduled data wise in the US calendar at the beginning of the week, although the dollar is expected to grab the driver’s seat later in the week in light of the FOMC event on November 2, where consensus among investors anticipate the Committee hiking rates by another 75 bps.

What to look for around USD

The dollar extends the rebound and adds to the rebound seen in the second half of last week above the key 111.00 mark.

In the meantime, the firmer conviction of the Federal Reserve to keep hiking rates until inflation looks well under control regardless of a likely slowdown in the economic activity and some loss of momentum in the labour market continues to prop up the underlying positive tone in the index.

Looking at the more macro scenario, the greenback also appears bolstered by the Fed’s divergence vs. most of its G10 peers in combination with bouts of geopolitical effervescence and occasional re-emergence of risk aversion.

Key events in the US this week: Final Manufacturing PMI, Construction Spending, ISM Manufacturing (Tuesday) – MBA Mortgage Applications, ADP Employment Change, FOMC Interest Rate Decision, Chief Powell press conference (Wednesday) – Balance of Trade, Initial Jobless Claims, Final Services PMI, ISM Non-Manufacturing (Thursday) – Nonfarm Payrolls, Unemployment Rate (Friday).

Eminent issues on the back boiler: Hard/soft/softish? landing of the US economy. Prospects for further rate hikes by the Federal Reserve vs. speculation of a recession in the next months. Geopolitical effervescence vs. Russia and China. US-China persistent trade conflict.

2022-10-31 10:54:27.553924,DailyForex,USD/BRL: Vote Concluded and Brazilian Real now awaits Frenzy,"The USD/BRL should provide speculators with a real wagering Forex environment today; this after Lula da Silva has apparently won the vote for President of Brazil.

The USD/BRL went into the weekend near the 5.2959 level this weekend, before the Brazilian election yesterday which saw Lula da Silva win. Noticeably on Friday the USD/BRL actually saw selling action emerge. This result of the vote creates a door for today’s early price action which will certainly produce a gap upon opening.

Advertisement Heavy swings in the dollar make highly profitable trades Make Your Move Now!

The question for speculators is which direction the USD/BRL will move in the first hour of trading today. While the left leaning Lula da Silva won a tightly contested race for President against Jair Bolsonaro, it was actually Bolsonaro’s political party that won a majority in the Brazilian Congress and this will create a strong opposition to policy if they do not agree with President’s proposed legislation.

Technical Charts will be Important, but Reaction and Behavioral Sentiment will be Critical

Intriguingly, Friday’s downturn with bearish traction going into the weekend may be a sign of things to come with the USD/BRL. While financial institutions may not be pleased with a victory by the left leaning Lula da Silva, a strong political opposition in Congress means economic policy may not be able to stray too far from the center, this may create more calm than expected for the USD/BRL near-term.

A rather volatile opening for the USD/BRL should be expected today, traders without any open positions may want to wait an hour while monitoring early price action to let the Forex landscape become calm.

The support ratio of 5.2600 should be watched as a lower strong realm if bearish selling builds and traders may look for reversals upwards. A move above the 5.3700 realm above may be considered too high a value by technical speculators.

Choppy Trading Expected with the Opportunity to Wager on Short-Term Direction

Today could prove to be a ‘classic’ day of Forex trading in the USD/BRL as financial institutions react to the outcome of the Brazilian election. Many days are ahead for the potential of economic policy which could create a storm for the USD/BRL, but in the short-term equilibrium may be rather hard to find which may produce rather whipsaw conditions.

Traders should be able to take advantage of the volatility and wager on upside when support levels are flirted with in the near-term. Lula da Silva has produced a victory and in the mid-term this is not likely to make the USD/BRL stronger. In the short-term it is likely to help speculators take advantage of potential reversals when support levels are proven durable.

Brazilian Real Short Term Outlook:

Current Resistance: 5.3160

Current Support: 5.2824

High Target: 5.3790

Low Target: 5.2620

Lula da Silva has produced a victory and in the mid-term this is not likely to make the USD/BRL stronger.

2022-10-31 07:54:27.565287,Nasdaq,"USD/INR cash rate at 3-month high on forward roll-overs, rupee liquidity","By Nimesh Vora

MUMBAI, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Forward roll overs and the rupee liquidity squeeze pushed the USD/INR overnight swap rate to its highest level since late July, traders said on Monday.

The USD/INR cash swap INRON=D3 rate was last traded at 0.96 paisa. On Friday, this rate was at about 0.90 paisa.

The latest increase in cash rate is likely being fuelled by the forward roll overs and the persistent banking rupee deficit, a trader at a Mumbai-based state-run bank said.

""Today is the last day of the month. Forward positions that are maturing today need to be rolled over,"" the trader said.

Meanwhile, India's banking system liquidity has been in deficit for the last two weeks amid tax outflows. The banking system liquidity deficit stood at 640 billion rupees ($7.77 billion).

A cash swap involves two banks exchanging dollars for rupee at around the spot rate and an agreement to reverse the trade the next working date at a rate that is higher than the spot rate. The difference between the two rates is the cash rate.

For instance, at the current cash rate of 96 paisa, one bank will buy dollars at 82.38 from another and this trade will be reversed on Tuesday at 82.3896.

The implied rupee funding rate can be calculated from the difference in the buy and sell rates and the overnight dollar funding rate. At the 96 paisa cash rate, the implied funding rate works out to about 7%.

The high cash rate will mean that near-term USD/INR forward premiums are likely to stay elevated, the state-run trader said.

It is a busy day for the EUR/USD. German retail sales will draw interest ahead of Q3 GDP numbers for Italy. However, while both sets of numbers will influence, prelim October inflation and Q3 GDP numbers for the Eurozone will likely draw the most attention.

Softer inflation and weak growth could give the ECB an option to deliver a less hawkish move in December. In the last ECB press conference, ECB President Lagarde noted that the ECB would need to wait until December to provide growth and inflation forecasts. Therefore, today’s numbers will likely influence projections and the ECB.

Away from the stats, ECB Philip Lane will deliver a speech at Denmark’s Nationalbank conference. References to today’s stats and monetary policy would move the dial.

EUR/USD Price Action

At the time of writing, the EUR was down 0.09% to $0.99569. A mixed start to the day saw the EUR/USD fall to an early low of $0.99425 before rising to a high of $0.99648.

The EUR/USD needs to move through the $0.9964 pivot to target the First Major Resistance Level (R1) at $1.0001. With the USeconomic calendaron the quiet side, today’s stats need to impress to support a return to parity.

In the case of an extended rally, the bulls will likely take a run at the Second Major Resistance Level (R2) at $1.0035. The Third Major Resistance Level (R3) sits at $1.0107.

Failure to move through the pivot would leave the First Major Support Level (S1) at $0.9929 in play. In the case of an extended sell-off, the EUR/USD pair would likely test the Second Major Support Level (S2) at $0.9892 and support at $0.9850.

The third Major Support Level (S3) sits at $0.9821. EURUSD 311022 Hourly Chart

Looking at the EMAs and the 4-hourly chart, the EMAs send a bullish signal. The EUR/USD sits above the 50-day EMA ($0.99139). The 50-day EMA pulled away from the 200-day EMA, with the 100-day EMA closing in on the 200-day EMA, delivering bullish signals.

Avoiding S1 ($0.9929) and the 50-day EMA ($0.99139) would give the bulls a run at R1 ($1.0001). However, a fall through S1 ($0.9929) and the 50-day EMA ($0.99139) would bring S2 ($0.9892) and the 200-day EMA ($0.98766) into view. The 100-day EMA sits at $0.98709. EURUSD 311022 4 Hourly Chart

No FOMC members will speak to guide the markets following today’s stats. The FOMC blackout period started on Saturday and will extend until November 3.

Going into the Monday session, the FedWatch Tool had the probability of November and December rate hikes at 80.3% and 44.3%, respectively. One week ago, the likelihood of a 75-basis point hike in December stood at 45.6%.

It is a quiet start to the week for the GBP/USD. According to the economic calendar, no UK economic indicators are due. The lack of UK stats leaves the Pound in the hands of the UK Government and the Bank of England.

While the markets await the full autumn report on November 17, drip feeding of government plans will continue to draw plenty of interest. However, market sentiment toward the Bank of England’s Thursday monetary policy decision will also be a key driver this week.

The markets expect the BoE to lift rates by 75 basis points to a 33-year high of 3%. However, with the new UK government having to tighten the purse strings, the impact of a 75-basis point rate hike could drive recession fears to test buyer appetite for the Pound.

No Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee members will deliver speeches ahead of the Thursday policy decision, leaving any comments to the media to influence.

GBP/USD Price Action

At the time of writing, the Pound was down 0.11% to $1.16012.

A mixed morning saw the GBP/USD rise to an early high of $1.16132 before falling to a low of $1.15620. GBPUSD 311022 Daily Chart

Technical Indicators

The Pound needs to avoid the $1.1580 pivot to target the First Major Resistance Level (R1) at $1.1657. A move through the Friday high of $1.16237 would signal a bullish session.

In the case of another extended rally, the GBP/USD would likely test the Second Major Resistance Level (R2) at $1.1701. The Third Major Resistance Level (R3) sits at $1.1821.

A fall through the pivot would bring the First Major Support Level (S1) at $1.1537 into play. However, barring a risk-off fueled sell-off, the Pound would likely avoid sub-$1.15 and the Second Major Support Level (S2) at $1.1460.

The Third Major Support Level (S3) sits at $1.1340. GBPUSD 311022 1-Hour Chart

A bullish cross of the 100-day EMA through the 200-day EMA would support a breakout from R1 ($1.1657) to bring $1.17 into view. However, a fall through S1 ($1.1537) would give the bears a run at S2 ($1.1460) and the 50-day EMA ($1.14381). GBPUSD 311022 4-Hourly Chart

2022-10-31 03:54:27.983370,FXStreet,Silver Price Analysis: XAG/USD stays defensive above $19.00 as bears keep the reins,"Silver price remains mildly offered while staying between 200-SMA and 50-SMA.

Downbeat oscillators, sustained break of weekly ascending trend line keeps bears hopeful.

Bulls need validation from $20.00 to retake control.

Silver price (XAG/USD) struggles to defend $19.00 as it seesaws inside a 20-pip area comprising the key SMAs during Monday’s Asian session.

Even so, bearish MACD signals join the downbeat RSI (14), not oversold, to keep the sellers hopeful.

Above that, the previous day’s downside break of a one-week-old ascending support line, now resistance around $19.65, also favors the XAG/USD bears.

Even if the quote rises past the $19.65 hurdle, a seven-week-old horizontal resistance area near $20.00, will be crucial for the silver buyers to cross before taking control. Following that, a run-up toward the monthly high of $21.24 can’t be ruled out.

Alternatively, a downside break of the 50-SMA level of $19.10, could poke the $19.00 threshold before directing the bears toward the monthly bottom surrounding $18.10.

Following that, the $18.00 round figure and previous monthly low near $17.55 will be in the spotlight.

It should be noted that the silver’s weakness past $17.55 won’t hesitate to aim for June 2020 low near $16.95.

To sum up, silver prices remain on the bear’s radar unless staying successfully beyond the $20.00 hurdle.

Earlier last week, the rapper purchased the seven-figure Jacob & Co. Mystery Tourbillon with special customizations, sharing a video of the heavily armed delivery to his home. In the video shared to his Instagram Story, Ross films a video of the van pulling up to Ross’ driveway. Two armed-delivery personnel emerge from the van and give Rozay a large box that contains the $1.5 million USD wrist piece.

In the video, Ross can be heard confirming, “This that Jacob delivery. Heavyweight.” He later explains the armoury stating, “They gotta be heavily armed when they making a Rozay delivery from Jacob. It ain’t normal. It ain’t regular.” According to Jacob & Co’s website, the watch features invisibly set baguette hexagonal diamonds, while the dial is set with hexagonal, overlapping diamonds. The company goes on to state the features of the watch, “The minute disk is set with 119 white diamonds (≈ 6.80 ct.) and one ruby (≈ 0.18ct.) to indicate the exact minute. The hour disk is also set with 119 white diamonds (≈ 7.93ct.) and one red ruby (≈ 0.28ct.) to show the hours. The outer ring is set with 108 white diamonds (≈ 4.56ct.) and 12 blue sapphires (≈ 1.49ct.) for the hour markers.”

Jacob & Co. also took to Instagram to note that the watch features “hundreds” of diamonds that have been “cut in bespoke shapes.” While the watch Ross has does not appear to feature sapphires due to its red-tone makeup, it is certain Ross’ watch is not short of any high quality, expensive stones.

China’s Manufacturing PMI slipped to 49.2 vs. 50.0 while Non-Manufacturing PMI dropped to 48.7 vs. 51.9 expected.

Kiwi’s weak projections for the labor cost index could dent the sentiment of households.

The NZD/USD pair has sensed selling pressure while attempting to overstep the critical hurdle of 0.5810 in the Tokyo session. The asset has witnessed stiff hurdles amid surpassing the immediate resistance of 0.5810. Downbeat Chinese PMI data weigh on kiwi bulls in collaboration with a rebound in risk-off mood amid accelerating anxiety ahead of the Federal Reserve (Fed)’s monetary policy.

China’s official Manufacturing PMI has landed lower at 49.2 vs. the projections of 50.0 and the prior release of 50.1, reported by the National Bureau of Statistics. Also, the Non-Manufacturing PMI has been recorded as significantly lower at 48.7 against the expectations of 51.9 and the former release of 50.6. The continuation of the no-tolerance Covid-19 policy has weighed pressure on economic activities.

The risk aversion theme is gaining traction as yields have rebounded after a bumpy ride. The 10-year US Treasury yields have accelerated to 4.05% while the S&P500 futures have extended their losses.

Also, the Fed is expected to hike interest rates by 75 basis points (bps) for the fourth time.

This week, the kiwi employment data will also remain in focus. The Employment Change for the third quarter is seen at 0.5% against the former print of 0%. While the Unemployment Rate could trim to 3.2% vs. 3.3% released earlier. The catalyst that could dampen the sentiment of households is a decline in the labor cost index, which is seen lower at 1% against the prior release of 1.3%.

Price pressures are skyrocketing in the kiwi economy and households need higher earnings to payout inflation-adjusted goods and services. Lower expansion in earnings would be unable to offset higher expenses, resulting in a slower demand in the NZ zone.","NZD/USD displays topsy-turvy moves after a downbeat release of China’s PMI data.

,FXStreet,"Silver Price Analysis: XAG/USD sees vulnerable, sustained weakness below $19.00 awaited","On the flip side, the $18.95-$18.90 zone coincides with the 23.6% Fibo. level. A convincing break below will be seen as a fresh trigger for bearish traders and expose the $18.00 mark, with some intermediate support near the $18.30-$18.25 region. The XAG/USD could eventually drop further to challenge the YTD low, around the $17.55 area.

A sustained strength beyond might trigger a short-covering move and allow the XAG/USD to reclaim the $20.00 psychological mark. The positive momentum could get extended towards an intermediate hurdle near the $20.50 area, above which bulls could target the $21.00 mark en route to the monthly peak, around the $21.25 region.

From a technical perspective, any subsequent move-up is likely to face resistance near the $19.30-$19.40 confluence support breakpoint. The said area comprises the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the sharp downfall from the monthly peak and the 100-hour SMA, which should now act as a pivotal point for intraday traders.

Silver reverses an intraday dip to sub-$19.00 levels, or a multi-day low and climbs to the top end of its daily trading range heading into the North American session. The XAG/USD pair is currently hovering around the $19.15-$19.20 region, still down over 0.20% for the day.

2022-10-31 03:54:28.625953,FXStreet,"Gold, Chart of the Week: XAU/USD its make or break time","Gold is at a crossroads as we head into the Fed this week.

The bears are lurking below a critical technical structure with price below trendline resistance.

Gold closed within last week's range on Friday, firmly back into the hands of the bears as the US dollar hung on into bullish territory despite declining for the second straight week, pressured by growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will turn less aggressive soon. Gold ended at $1,644.38, down some 1.14% falling from a high of $1,667.11 and falling to a low of $1,638.12. The DXY index, which measures the greenback v.s a basket of currencies fell to a low of 110.288 and backed up again from key trendline support, thus will it remain vulnerable to the risk events ahead this week.

The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to deliver a fourth consecutive 75bp rate hike next week where it might want to bring policy to a level at which whereby it will be shifting to a steadier hiking pace. However, the hot US Consumer Price Index will likely keep the fire burning at the Fed. The focus will be on the press conference where guidance for future increases could move the needle and after four jumbo-sized hikes, the chairman, Jerome Powell, may want to gauge economic responses before committing to anything besides hiking rates in the face of market speculating that the Fed would slow the pace of rate hikes amid concerns about overtightening. Meanwhile, the greenback jumped 0.8% on Thursday after data showed that the US economy expanded 2.6% YoY in the third quarter, exceeding forecasts for a 2.4% growth and rebounding from two consecutive quarters of economic contraction.

Money managers have aggressively covered their short gold exposure, as talk of a Fed pivot drove rates and the greenback lower but the data of late put gold back into reverse. Moreover, as analysts at TD Securities explained, ''despite the price moving higher and markets musing about inflation turning lower in the not too distant future and hoping the US central bank would sharply reduce the pace of tightening, long exposure did not increase one bit.''

''This suggests to us that while traders don’t see rates accelerating much beyond what is currently priced, at the same time they don’t see a dovish tilt anytime soon. Indeed, gold prices are likely to head lower.''

Gold & DXY chart

Moving to the charts, first looking to the US dollar, its all or nothing this week:

The price, as per the W-formation on the weekly chart, could be still in its evolution in terms of the downside with room to go to test between 107.70s and the 109.50s. However, for now, the index is being rejected from familiar trendline support and if we zoom down to the daily chart, the rejection is powerful which may mean there is more to come from the bulls in the days leading into the Fed. A break of 112.00 could be significant in this respect:

Moving back to gold, a close below Friday's low will be troublesome for the committed bulls while below the weekly trendline resistance, despite what could be a double bottom:

On the daily chart, the M-formation might only be in its early stages of development, but nonetheless, it's there and the price could move beyond last week's highs of $1,675 which could potentially signify that the inverse head and shoulders are in play. This will leave a focus on a break of the trendline resistance and then a critical structure of $1,688:

Meanwhile, on the downside, while below the weekly trendline, given that the price has already corrected to a 50% mean reversion of the prior bearish impulse, and considering it has failed to break key resistance so far, there is a strong argument for a downside extension:

The monthly chart could turn out a November candle such as the following:","Gold is at a crossroads as we head into the Fed this week.

2022-10-31 08:54:28.638205,Hypebeast,JAY-Z 2022 Net Worth Revealed To Be $1.5 Billion USD,"JAY-Z has once again cemented himself as an all-time great, this time not just in the music industry, but as a businessman. It comes as no surprise that the world of hip-hop is a tough business, so to be one of the biggest rappers in the history of the game, Hov’s success is not only reflected in the charts but in his monetary success as well.

Former Forbes editor Zack O’Malley Greenburg has recently released a list of the wealthiest hip-hop artists in 2022. In his list, Greenburg highlights JAY-Z as the richest, with a fortune of $1.5 billion USD. Hov’s status continues to grow after he became hip-hop’s first billionaire, paving the way for others in the industry. A large chunk of his wealth comes from his ownership in Roc Nation as well as his champagne company, Armand de Brignac. He has also taken up stakes in growing businesses including Rihanna‘s Savage x Fenty and D’Usse. Next in the billionaire category is Sean “Diddy Combs, coming in with $1 billion USD in net worth this year. With his continuous Cîroc partnership and other assets including DeLeón tequila and Revolt, on top of his music catalog, the artist is pushing well into the ten-figure territory.

The artist formerly known as Kanye West has recently been in some hot waters lately. With the end of his adidas deal, Ye is no longer a billionaire. While that is the case, he still remains one of the wealthiest hip-hop artists, with a reported net worth of around $500 million USD due to his rights to his master recordings and music publishing, as well as his 5% stake in his ex-wife Kim Kardashian‘s shapewear company, Skims.

Berner clocks in with a net worth of $410 million USD, thanks to his Cookies cannabis empire. The business is a foundation of his wealth and due to its unusual business structure, it could allow the rapper to one day buy out all the local partners and acreate a unified multibillion-dollar cannabis conglomerate. Currently he owns 30% of the company. The legendary Dr. Dre rounds out the top five with $400 million USD in net worth with his Beats partnership, music catalog and ongoing projects.

In case you missed it, Drake made a special guest appearance during Lil Wayne’s Lil WeezyAna Fest.","Former Forbes editor Zack O’Malley Greenburg has recently released a list of the wealthiest hip-hop artists in 2022.

2022-10-31 05:54:28.650003,Marca,Twitter will charge 20 USD per month if users want to maintain their verification,"Twitter users who have spent years generating their audience and achieved the long-awaited verification of their account by the platform, will now have to open their wallet if they want to keep that badge.

Verification on Twitter, so far, is granted to public figures, institutions, companies or those who have a good number of followers and are socially relevant. And there is no cost.

But according to a recent report, now that Elon Musk is its owner, the whole verification process will be renewed and, what is worse, those who already have it will have to pay 20 USD per month if they want to keep it.

Among Musk's renovations is raising prices

""The entire verification process is being revamped right now,"" Musk tweeted on Sunday. According to the report, the company wants to increase its optional premium subscription - called Twitter Blue - from $4.99 to $19.99 a month.

In return, Twitter will add more features, including verification, to bring its subscription up to what it wants to charge. But those who want to do so, i.e., current verified users have 90 days to subscribe to the new Twitter Blue after its launch or they'll lose the blissful verification.

Musk wants to squeeze money out of his investment any way he can

One of Musk's ideas is to increase the number of Twitter subscribers until they become half of the company's revenue.

To date, Twitter Blue offers access to ad-free articles and a few extra customization tweaks. In addition, Musk has commented that he intends for Twitter advertising to generate the most revenue.

This, together with his statements that he will give space to any type of expression, have provoked fears that it will become more aggressive and with more hate speech and xenophobia than it already has.","Twitter users who have spent years generating their audience and achieved the long-awaited verification of their account by the platform, will now have to open their wallet if they want to keep that badge.

2022-10-31 10:54:28.674835,Reuters,Egypt's pound sinks further against dollar after flexibility pledge,"













CAIRO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Egypt's pound fell about 3% to 23.8 against the dollar as trading resumed on Sunday, Refinitiv data showed, after authorities committed to a flexible exchange rate under an International Monetary Fund support deal.

The pound slid about 14.5% to 23.1 against the dollar on Thursday after they pledged a ""durably flexible"" exchange rate in conjunction with a staff-level agreement for a $3 billion IMF extended fund facility.

Egypt's currency has been held steady or allowed to depreciate only gradually following previous sharp devaluations in 2016 and this March. It has weakened about 34% against the dollar so far this year.

In a note on Thursday, JP Morgan said it considered the pound to be fairly priced, and that it expected a gradual adjustment to 23.5 to the dollar by the end of the year.

""We expect USD/EGP to remain under pressure in the coming days as it finds a clearing level, but we view (Thursday's) adjustment as sufficient to close most of the external imbalances,"" the note said.

Egypt has been struggling to cope with the impact of the war in Ukraine, which led to rapid outflows of portfolio investments, a hike in the commodity import bill and a drop in tourism revenues.

It introduced a mandatory requirement for importers to use letters of credit, leading to a sharp slowdown in imports and bottlenecks at ports.

The central bank has said that requirement will be gradually phased out by December.

""Moving forward, it is essential that Egypt follows through on its promise for currency flexibility rather than managing future deprecation and allowing imbalances to build back up,"" said Patrick Curran, a senior economist at Tellimer.

The IMF programme could catalyze enough funds to meet external funding needs estimated at $40 billion over the coming year, with devaluation and an out-of-cycle 200 basis point interest rate hike on Thursday helping to contain financing needs by dampening import demands, Curran said.

2022-10-31 04:54:28.688037,Business Standard,Adani group to invest $150 billion in pursuit of $1 trillion valuation,"Richest Asian Gautam Adani's group will invest over USD 150 billion across businesses ranging from to data centres to airports and healthcare as it chases the dream to join the elite global club of with USD 1 trillion valuations.

On October 10, Chief Financial Officer Jugeshinder 'Robbie' Singh detailed the growth plans of the group, which started off as a trader in 1988 and expanded rapidly into ports, airports, roads, power, renewable energy, power transmission, gas distribution and FMCG and more recently into data centres, airports, petrochemicals, cement and media, at an investor meet organised by Ventura Securities Ltd in New Delhi.

The group plans to invest USD 50-70 billion in green hydrogen business and another USD 23 billion in over the next 5-10 years, he said. It will invest USD 7 billion in electricity transmission, USD 12 billion in transport utility and USD 5 billion in the road sector.

Its foray into data centre business with cloud services would entail an investment of USD 6.5 billion in partnership with Edge ConneX and another USD 9-10 billion is planned for airports, where it is already the largest private operator. Its foray into the cement sector with the acquisition of ACC and Ambuja cement entailed USD 10 billion investment.

It is foraying into the petrochemical business with plans to set up a 1 million tonnes per annum PVC manufacturing facility at an investment of USD 2 billion and would enter the copper sector with a 0.5 million tonnes a year smelter at an investment of USD 1 billion, he said.

The healthcare sector foray that will include insurance, hospitals and diagnostic and pharma would see an investment of USD 7-10 billion, with some coming from Adani Foundation.

""Whatever you see today, it might look like it has just happened in the last one or two years, but in reality what we have done, both GSA (Gautam Shantilal Adani) and myself discussed this in 2015,"" Singh said at the investor meeting adding the conglomerate is a result of a well-thought-out business plan that entailed foraying into adjacencies of existing business.

The group's market capitalisation was around USD 16 billion in 2015 and it is USD 260 billion in 2022 - a surge of over 16x in seven years.

""Given what we had as a set of companies, we believed that if we had assets and of that type we should really be a USD 1 trillion group. So we went through the steps that we needed to take to get to the point,"" he said.

There are only a handful of that are valued at trillion dollars or more. These include Apple, Saudi Aramco, Microsoft, Google's parent Alphabet and Amazon.

Singh said the has set about building its infrastructure and logistics portfolio in a manner that it could emerge as the top five globally and not just India's largest player.

""Look at Adani Ports, Adani transmission, Adani Total Gas, Adani Power, combined when you look at these businesses, these businesses are in total infra and utility portfolio was formed by four core portfolios,"" he said. ""It is the fastest growing portfolio of any comparable size infra portfolio. Our primary industry vertical materials metals and mining again sits next to our core of the infrastructure.""



Explaining the logic being the expansions, he said for a trading company it made sense for to be in the ports business. And since energy is vital for this, the foray into distributed energy and finally into gas to provide an integrated logistics and infrastructure portfolio.

The recent foray into metals and mining is an extension of this as logistics and warehousing is an integral part of the cement business.

Given that power and logistics are the largest components of any metals and materials business, the group has seen it fit to enter copper, aluminum and cement businesses, he said.

Stating that power continues to be core to the Group's future growth plans, he said Adani is making the biggest bet by any Indian group in building the chain for producing hydrogen - the fuel of the future - as well as renewable energy plants.

Most businesses of the Adani Group enjoy the best-in-class margins. The ports business has reported operating margins of 70 per cent, while its closest competitor's margins are at 56 per cent. Adani Total Gas has reported margins of 41 per cent, while Adani Tranmission's operating margin is at 92 per cent. The businesses are profitable and efficient and generate high levels of free cash flows.

On financials, Singh said the group generates earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of USD 8 billion. Of this, about USD 3.6 billion is spent on servicing debt (interest and principal). USD 700 million goes towards tax payments and businesses spend USD 1.8 billion towards capex.

While in absolute terms the Group's debt has gone up, so has its EBITDA, he said adding over the last nine years, the Group's EBITDA has grown 23 per cent CAGR, while debt has grown by 12 per cent.

Singh said flagship Adani Enterprises is the group's business incubator. Ports, power, transmission and gas businesses were all incubated by this company and when they reached a certain degree of maturity, they were spun off into separate companies and listed on bourses.

The same will be the approach for several new businesses such as airports being nurtured under AEL. When they become independent and can fund their own capital expenditure plans, they will be separated, he said.

In the next 2-3 years, hydrogen and airports businesses can be demerged when they can be independent.

""Adani Group's transformation is a 25-year story of growth and ambition,"" he added.

The Fed-BoJ policy divergence continues to undermine the JPY and offers support.

The uptick lacks bullish conviction as the focus remains on the key FOMC meeting.

The USD/JPY pair edges higher for the second straight day on Monday and looks to build on its recovery from the 145.00 psychological mark, or a nearly three-week low touched last Thursday. The pair sticks to its modest gains through the first half of the European session and is currently placed near a multi-day high, just below mid-148.00s.

The Japanese yen continues to be undermined by the fact that the Bank of Japan held interest rates at record lows on Friday and reiterated that it will continue to guide the 10-year bond yield at 0%. The central bank reaffirmed the need for accommodative policy amid economic headwinds stemming from the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China and global recession fears. This, along with some follow-through US dollar buying interest continues to lend support to the USD/JPY pair.

In fact, the USD Index, which measures the greenback's performance against a basket of currencies, extends last week's bounce from over a one-month low amid rising US Treasury bond yields. The prospects for another supersized 75 bps Fed rate hike move in November turn out to be a key factor pushing the US bond yields higher and lending some support to the greenback. The USD bulls, however, seem reluctant to place aggressive bets ahead of this week's key central bank event risk.

The Fed is scheduled to announce its monetary policy decision on Wednesday and investors will look for fresh clues about the future rate-hike path. Hence, the focus will remain on the accompanying policy statement and the post-meeting press conference. This will influence the USD price dynamics and help determine the next leg of a directional move for the USD/JPY pair. In the meantime, elevated US bond yields should act as a tailwind for the USD amid absent relevant economic data.

The BoJ intends to increase the frequency of its bond purchases starting next month.

The dollar is climbing ahead of the Fed’s rate decision.

Today’s USD/JPY forecast is bullish. As concerns about a global recession dim the outlook for a robust recovery, the Bank of Japan held its ultra-low interest rates on Friday and kept its dovish stance. It solidified its position as an outlier among central banks worldwide, tightening monetary policy.

-Are you looking for automated trading? Check our detailed guide-

The central bank reinforced its commitment to defending its ultra-loose monetary policy by announcing intentions to increase the frequency of its bond purchases starting next month.

According to BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, Japan is moving closer to meeting its 2% inflation objective.

However, he said that the central bank was far from raising interest rates. Kuroda dismissed the idea that the BOJ’s yield cap was to blame for the recent significant decreases in the value of the yen, confirming expectations that he won’t use rate hikes as a tool to arrest the currency’s declines.

Despite Kuroda’s dovish stance, the BOJ raised its inflation expectations and declared that price risks favored the upside.

On the other hand, the dollar has risen after a slew of positive data last week diminished hopes of a Fed pivot. Markets are expecting a 75bps hike this week.

“Markets have been kind of expecting a Fed pivot on monetary policy. I think that is too premature, given how resilient the economy has been and particularly how high inflation has been,” said Carol Kong, a currency strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA).

Moreover, inflows by foreign investors supported the rupee at lower levels.

“We expect the rupee to trade with a negative bias amid strong US dollar amid increasing odds of an aggressive rate hike by the Fed on Wednesday. Some recovery in crude oil prices may also weigh on Rupee,” Choudhary added.

Traders may remain cautious ahead of manufacturing PMI and trade deficit data, which is expected to be released on Tuesday, Choudhary said, adding, “We expect USD-INR spot price to trade in the range of 81.80 and 83.30 in the next couple of sessions.” Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, rose 0.28 per cent to 111.05.

Germany Retail Sales contracted less than expected in September.

Flash EMU Q3 GDP, CPI next of relevance in the domestic docket.

Sellers remain in control of the sentiment surrounding the European currency and force EUR/USD to slip back to the vicinity of the 0.9900 neighbourhood at the beginning of the week.

EUR/USD looks to data, dollar dynamic

EUR/USD adds to the rejection from last week’s tops near 1.0100 and trades at shouting distance from the key support at 0.9900 on Monday, always on the back of the continuation of the robust bounce in the dollar.

Indeed, investors keep favouring the greenback in the current context of weakness in the risk-associated universe and in light of the upcoming FOMC gathering due on Wednesday. On the latter, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise the Fed Funds Target Range (FFTR) by 75 bps to 3.75%-4.00%.

Earlier in the domestic calendar Retail Sales in Germany expanded at a monthly 0.9% and contracted 0.9% in the year to September. Later, the focus of attention will be on the release of advanced Q3 GDP Growth Rate in the broader Euroland as well as preliminary inflation figures for te month of October.

What to look for around EUR

EUR/USD extends the leg lower and threatens to revisit the 0.9900 neighbourhood against the backdrop of persistence dollar strength.

In the meantime, price action around the European currency is expected to closely follow dollar dynamics, geopolitical concerns and the Fed-ECB divergence. The resurgence of speculation around a potential Fed’s pivot seems to have removed some strength from the latter, however.

Furthermore, the increasing speculation of a potential recession in the region - which looks propped up by dwindling sentiment gauges as well as an incipient slowdown in some fundamentals – adds to the fragile sentiment around the euro in the longer run.

Eminent issues on the back boiler: Continuation of the ECB hiking cycle vs. increasing recession risks. Impact of the war in Ukraine and the persistent energy crunch on the region’s growth prospects and inflation outlook.

US Dollar Index (DXY) rally could fade in the days ahead

Another leg lower will bring into play important trend support

Recommended by Paul Robinson Get Your Free USD Forecast Get My Guide

US Dollar Technical Forecast for the Week Ahead

The US Dollar Index (DXY) came off hard last week as bonds and stocks rallied. As we head into a new week the focus will be on whether this theme can continue or not. The thinking is that we will see it continue and thus any rally that develops in the dollar for now will fade.

If the DXY can rally up to 111.77 there is a bit of resistance as the low of the range that proceeded last week’s decline comes into play.

On the downside the big technical threshold to watch is the trend-line from February. It lies not far beneath the swing-low at 109.63. The high from July is in that vicinity too. The parallel of the line off the highs is down there as well, but it is unproven so at this time regarded as only a possible level of support in need of validation.

A drop into trend support may end the decline for the dollar, but if we are to see a broader recovery in bonds (lower rates) and stocks then the dollar is also likely coming off even more that just to trend support. If this is the case then the trend-line may not hold, and support down at 107.68 may come into play.

But we will first need to see how price action plays out. A drop onto trend support and reversal will skew risk back to the upside. Overall, for now, the thinking is more downward pressure and a rally from here will fail, but we will need to be nimble as the outlook isn’t as clear as it was a week ago.

US Dollar Index (DXY) rally could fade in the days ahead

Another leg lower will bring into play important trend support

US Dollar Technical Forecast for the Week Ahead

The US Dollar Index (DXY) came off hard last week as bonds and stocks rallied. As we head into a new week the focus will be on whether this theme can continue or not. The thinking is that we will see it continue and thus any rally that develops in the dollar for now will fade.

If the DXY can rally up to 111.77 there is a bit of resistance as the low of the range that proceeded last week’s decline comes into play.

On the downside the big technical threshold to watch is the trend-line from February. It lies not far beneath the swing-low at 109.63. The high from July is in that vicinity too. The parallel of the line off the highs is down there as well, but it is unproven so at this time regarded as only a possible level of support in need of validation.

A drop into trend support may end the decline for the dollar, but if we are to see a broader recovery in bonds (lower rates) and stocks then the dollar is also likely coming off even more that just to trend support. If this is the case then the trend-line may not hold, and support down at 107.68 may come into play.

But we will first need to see how price action plays out. A drop onto trend support and reversal will skew risk back to the upside. Overall, for now, the thinking is more downward pressure and a rally from here will fail, but we will need to be nimble as the outlook isn’t as clear as it was a week ago.

UPDATE: A previous version of this report mischaracterized the data from BanG Dream, presenting only data from the Global release. The information has been corrected and we apologize for the error.

The data shows that the game’s incredibly popular in Japan, with 90% of the game’s revenue coming from the Japanese players and global only accounting for 6% of the overall data.

D4DJ’s main competition comes in the form of fellow Bushiroad mixed media project BanG Dream- the title is a stronghold IP under Bushiroad, with the Japanese version alone raking in over 440 million USD in its lifetime

Despite the lower numbers, D4DJ is sporting a very healthy level of activity- both the Japanese and Global versions of the game are home to a multitude of licensed crossover events, including properties like NieR: Automata and the Quintessential Quintuplets.

Of course, part of Bushiroad’s strategy is a mixed media approach, and the D4DJ series has also been receiving appropriate support with multiple animated projects alongside the Groovy Mix mobile game.

That being said, by Bushiroad’s own admission, none of its titles are particularly pushing the envelope in terms of growth- their financial report for Fiscal Year 2022 published in August (Bushiroad’s fiscal year runs June-June) describes their games department as stagnating.

“Sales from our existing titles for application game was stagnant in mobile online game market where top brands oligopoly has occurred, and sales in the Dept. as a whole got [softened]“, the report reads.

This result is reflected in D4DJ’s earnings as well- looking at the same range, the game made 2 million USD less in Bushiroad’s FY2022 as compared to FY2021 (14 million in 2021 to 12.6 million in 2022).","D4DJ Groovy Mix has made over 28 million USD in earnings,UPDATE: A previous version of this report mischaracterized the data from BanG Dream, presenting only data from the Global release.

The EUR/USD price pulled back slightly after the latest interest rate decision by the ECB and the strong American PCE data. It dropped to a low of 0.9965, which was lower than last week’s high of 1.0095. The price remains about 4.47% above the lowest level in October.

EU inflation and Fed decision ahead

The European Central Bank continued its monetary policy meeting last week and decided to hike rates by0.75% for the second meeting in a row. The move pushed the main interest rate to 1.5%, the highest level in more than a decade.

At the same time, the bank decided to tighten its screws for European banks by limiting payments it makes to them. Banks used these ultralow interest rates to lend to both people and companies. In her statement, Christine Lagarde said that the bank would continue hiking interest rates further in the coming meetings even as she cautioned about the state of the economy.

The EUR/USD and EU bond yields declined because her statement sounded a bit dovish. Focus now shifts to the preliminary European consumer inflation data scheduled for later today. Economists expect the data to show that the headline consumer inflation rose from 9.9% to 10.2% in October.

Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, is expected to have remained at 4.8%. Analysts expect that the bloc’s inflation will ease slightly since European gas prices have dropped recently. At some point this month, gas prices moved to the negative level due to near-full storage.

The EUR/USD price will also react to the latest interest rate decision by the Federal Reserve. Economists are pricing an additional 0.75% rate hike by the Fed. The bank has already hiked rates by 300 basis points this year.

EUR/USD forecast

The EUR/USD price pulled back slightly after the ECB interest rate decision. As it dropped, it moved slightly below the important support level at 0.9996, which was the highest level on October 5. The current price is along the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level. It also retreated from the third resistance of the standard pivot point to the first resistance.

The pair remains slightly above the 25-day and 50-day moving averages. Therefore, the outlook is still bullish, with the next key resistance level being at 1.0100.

Glass fiber will be applied in the form of ceramic supports, frits and glazes to reduce tile firing temperature. Inks will be manufactured with the glycols and carbon fiber will be used to make sustainable composites for the transport sector.

University of Minnesota Twin Cities Partnered with Kiel University in Germany

On November 17th, 2021; An international team of researchers from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities and Kiel University in Germany discovered a path that could lead to shape-shifting ceramic materials. This discovery could improve everything from medical devices to electronics. In this new research, the route to producing a reversible shape memory ceramic was anything but straightforward. The researchers first tried a recipe that has worked for the discovery of new metallic shape memory materials. That involves a delicate tuning of the distances between atoms by compositional changes, so that the two phases fit together well. They implemented this recipe, but, instead of improving the deformability of the ceramic, they observed that some specimens exploded when they passed through the phase transformation.

Samba Step system Partnered with Augsburg University

On July 22nd, 2021; Two research organizations joined forces for projects on patch-based fiber layup: The Institute of Materials Resource Management (MRM) at Augsburg University (Augsburg, Germany), which focuses on ceramic fiber composites and data-driven computational materials science, and the faculty of mechanical engineering at Augsburg University of Applied Sciences (Augsburg, Germany).
