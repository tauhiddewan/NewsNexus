2022-10-31 08:59:46.664500,Reuters,Hong Kong proposes allowing retail trade in cryptocurrencies,"













HONG KONG, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's government has proposed allowing retail investors to trade in cryptocurrencies and crypto exchange-traded funds - a move it hopes will help it rebuild its fintech hub status.

The city, which previously proposed limiting crypto trade to professional investors, has seen planned rules for digital assets heavily criticised for stifling innovation, prompting a slew of start-ups to move to other markets such as Singapore and Dubai.

Authorities will start a consultation process on giving retail investors ""a suitable degree of access"" to virtual assets, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in a keynote address broadcast to the Hong Kong Fintech Week conference.

""We want to make our policy stance clear to the global market, to demonstrate our determination to explore fintech with the global virtual asset community,"" he said.

The government will also review property rights for tokenised assets and explore legalising so-called smart contracts - self-executing transactions whose results depend on pre-programmed inputs.

These moves are likely to pave the way for real estate security token offerings (STOs), industry players said. STOs are blockchain-based tokens that represent ownership interests or entitle holders to income or dividends generated from real assets.

The latest announcement could put Hong Kong's rules on a par with those of Singapore, said Andy Mehan, chief compliance officer for APAC at U.S. crypto exchange Gemini.

""Industry participants want to see consistency in the global regulatory regime, otherwise there will be opportunities for bad actors to exploit loopholes in jurisdictions with less rigid laws,"" he said.

While Singapore allows retail investors to trade in cryptocurrencies, its central bank has been discouraging the public from speculative trading in cryptocurrencies and brought in restrictions on the advertising of cryptocurrency services in public places. It is also proposing new measures.

Hong Kong's latest move to legalise retail crypto trade would also set Hong Kong further apart from mainland China, which has a imposed a blanket ban on cryptocurrency trade.

""This is a positive move as it sends out a strong message that Hong Kong is taking a different approach in regulating its capital market,"" said Adrian Wang, chief executive of crypto brokerage Metalpha.

Dogecoin Market Cap Hits More Than $15 Million After The Price Surge

The past week has been incredible for DOGE after what had been many months of lackluster sideways performance.

At the time of writing, the memecoin’s price is trading around $0.116, up 96% in the last week. Here is a chart that shows the recent trend in the value of the crypto:

As you can see in the above graph, Dogecoin has observed some sharp upwards momentum during recent days.

Though, while the weekly gains of the crypto are incredible, the last 24 hours haven’t been so kind to it. In this period, the original memecoin has taken a beating of around 13%.

There had been some signs of whales preparing to dump yesterday, as they transferred a large number of coins to exchanges. It’s possible this selling was responsible for the price tumble today.

Before this decline, DOGE’s price was up more than 110% during the preceding seven days. Nonetheless, regardless of the drawdown, the fact remains that the coin has seen some explosive growth lately, and as a result of it, the memecoin has jumped up spots in the top crypto by market cap list.

The below table shows where Dogecoin stands in the current cryptocurrency environment.

Looks like all the coins in the bottom half of the top ten list have seen negative returns during the last 24 hours | Source: CoinMarketCap

Dogecoin has now risen to the eighth position in the top crypto by market cap list, passing above Cardano to do so.

Though currently the gap between the two is just around $1.1 billion so that DOGE will need to see further growth in the coming days if it has to create some safe distance from ADA.

The seventh placed coin, Binance USD, isn’t within reach of the memecoin at the moment, as its market cap is about $6 billion more than DOGE’s.

Rival coin Shiba Inu has also seen some decent surge recently, but its rise has been nowhere near as sharp as Dogecoin’s. As a consequence, SHIB is still only 13th on the list.

As for ADA’s recent trend, its price is currently around $0.404, up 15% in the last week. Below is the chart for the crypto.

Bitcoin rose 6.2% over the past week, finishing near $20.7K. The bulls over the weekend managed to rewrite local highs (touching levels above $21K) but again triggered a wave of profit-taking, forcing BTCUSD to retreat to the $20.5K area.

Ethereum has gained 18% in seven days, to $1590. Other leading altcoins have gained between 12.5% (BNB) and 98% (Dogecoin). The exception was XRP (-0.4%).

The total capitalisation of the crypto market, according to CoinMarketCap, rose 8.6% for the week to $1.01 trillion. The crypto Fear & Greed Index fell from 34 to 31 by Monday, markedly above 22 a week earlier.

Investors in the crypto market have cheered over the past week, supported by a weaker dollar and a rally in equities. However, there is still a significant overhang of selling triggered at any significant technical levels - previous highs or round levels. This trading mode will likely persist until the FOMC meeting on Wednesday evening but could stretch into weeks.

Dogecoin showed the best momentum, doubling in value in a week after Elon Musk purchased Twitter. DOGE took eighth in the cryptocurrency capitalisation ranking, pushing below Cardano and Solana.

News background

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has speculated that Dogecoin could be integrated with Twitter and suggested that the meme cryptocurrency could be moved to the Cardano blockchain to be able to add support for smart contracts.

According to Morgan Stanley, investors are gearing up for a big bitcoin sell-off. According to the bank, investors who bought the cryptocurrency at the top of the market are waiting for the BTC rally to resume to dump the asset at the highest possible price.

The rise in cryptocurrencies will be preceded by an increase in Stablecoin capitalisation, according to Santiment.

According to CryptoCompare, October saw the lowest cryptocurrency trading volume among institutions. However, total assets under management (AUM) across all digital asset investment products rose for the first time since July.

Social network Twitter said it would add a new feature allowing users to buy, sell and display non-fiat tokens (NFTs) directly through tweets.","The total capitalisation of the crypto market, according to CoinMarketCap, rose 8.6% for the week to $1.01 trillion.

2022-10-31 04:59:46.700257,Forbes,Crypto Law Experts Suggest SEC Likely To Lose Key Case And Discredit Howey Test,"SEC v. Ripple is coming to a close at Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse in Manhattan in New ... [+] York City, USA getty

As the cryptocurrency trial of the century draws to an close in a Manhattan federal court, there are increasing signs that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) faces a bruising defeat against the San Francisco-based enterprise blockchain innovator Ripple Labs. The verdict could drastically limit the SEC’s authority to regulate crypto in the United States. If that’s how it ends, it will have been a self-inflicted disaster from the start.

The SEC filed its bombshell lawsuit against Ripple and its two senior executives in December 2020, on the last day in office for ex-chairman Jay Clayton. The Republican voted with the two Democratic commissioners to allege that the cryptocurrency XRP is an unregistered security because its only utility since 2013 has been to be an investment contract in a company that uses it for its payment software.

The breadth of the allegations was sweeping as the lawsuit’s legal theory overreached. Almost two years later, the SEC faces a painful reckoning because Ripple decided to fight back, as did tens of thousands of retail users of XRP who have no connection to Ripple other than being co-victims of the government’s behavior.

The SEC realized early in the litigation that they’d gotten lost in a maze of its own making. The stellar defense team for Ripple went for the jugular, calling out the bizarre SEC premise that XRP had been an unregistered investment contract in Ripple since 2013 and that even sales of billions of XRP tokens on the secondary market for seven years were securities as well. Ripple didn’t need to look too hard to document how the SEC had repeatedly waffled before market participants for years over whether XRP was a security. Yet, it now alleged that Ripple and everyone else in the market should have known anyway.

Ripple also focused on a market-moving speech in 2018 by Clayton’s Director of Corporation Finance, William Hinman, who laid out a vision of how XRP’s chief market rival in the crypto markets — Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency ether — was not a security because its ledger had “decentralized” over time. The internal SEC emails and drafts behind that speech became central to Ripple’s rebuttal, and the SEC spent 18 months fighting six separate bench orders to turn them over, making it increasingly clear that their real behind-the-scenes confusion around tokens would be humiliating if it ever went public.

Ripple finally got the Hinman speech documents last month, CEO (and co-defendant) Brad Garlinghouse tweeted that the SEC “wants you to think that it cares about disclosure, transparency and clarity. Don’t believe them. When the truth eventually comes out, the shamefulness of their behavior here will shock you.”

Now that the parties have reached the end of an exhaustive discovery phase with dueling motions for summary judgment, Ripple fired off a robust set of arguments while the SEC’s motion was just a warmed-over version of its original complaint. Some legal observers noted that the agency failed to prove its case. Its own expert said XRP’s market value was not tied to Ripple’s performance, and it didn’t find any way after two years to demonstrate on how tens of thousands of retail users and traders of XRP knew that the token was an investment in a company that most of them had never heard of.

This is where the case really went south for the government. Retail XRP holders launched themselves into the case by the tens of thousands. Led by Rhode Island attorney John Deaton, they first attempted to intervene against the SEC by asking the judge to make them defendants along with Ripple. The SEC responded with a ferocious attempt to malign Deaton personally and portray his clients as unworthy cranks.

Instead of turning her nose up at the XRP holders without comment, Judge Analisa Torres denied their motion to intervene by saying she’d spent time digging into legal precedent to see whether it was even possible for a party to make itself a defendant in a case, and came up empty. But she offered them the chance to file amicus briefs instead, sending a blunt signal to the SEC that real investors were going to have her ear when its presumptions of their motivations would be pondered. In retrospect, with all that has happened since, anyone with a political instinct close to Gensler should have convinced him to fold then and there.

Deaton’s putative class of XRP holders has swelled to more than 75,000, among whom more than 3,000 provided affidavits to Ripple’s defense team stating that they had never heard of the company they were allegedly investing in before the SEC filed the lawsuit. Those affidavits were entered as evidence with Ripple’s motion for summary judgment, which was a brutal takedown of a federal agency at odds with its own mission to protect retail investors, appealing to authority granted in the 1946 Howey decision from the Supreme Court to argue that anonymous lines of computer code are investment contracts in a company.

Behind Deaton were other XRP users with no connection to Ripple who have filed amicus briefs, as well as the two most prominent crypto industry associations, the Digital Chamber of Commerce and the Blockchain Association. The SEC has had no allies, not even its own expert witnesses who ended up giving ammunition to the defense. Attorney Jeremy Hogan, who has followed the case on his popular YouTube channel, says the SEC can only prevail with its summary judgment motion if Judge Torres “forgets her first year of law school.”

Prominent legal experts like Curt Levey of the Federalist Society and Professor J.W. Verret of George Mason University’s Scalia School of Law agree that Ripple is on track to win this case. Worse for the SEC, Verret predicts that if the SEC appeals up to the Supreme Court, it is likely to not only lose but set a sweeping precedent that would limit or eliminate entirely the application of Howey on cryptocurrencies, which defy the definitions of 1946.

So why is Gensler still letting his Enforcement Division drive this bus off a cliff? They are litigators, but Gensler is ultimately a political figure. Politicians, Deaton said recently in an interview, are all about turning a loss somehow into a win and moving on. Ripple’s general counsel, Stuart Alderoty, has made it clear that they will settle “in minutes” and pay a fine if the SEC will make it clear that today’s XRP is not a security. Having expended his political capital, Gensler should take the deal.","The SEC realized early in the litigation that they’d gotten lost in a maze of its own making.

2022-10-31 04:59:46.702160,Decrypt,"Visa, PayPal, Western Union Among Fall Flurry of Crypto Trademark Filings","In a striking counterpoint to the heightened crypto skepticism during the current bear market, financial services giants Visa, PayPal, and Western Union were among the notable firms that filed new trademark applications involving crypto and Web3 related products and services in the past week.

Visa eyeing a crypto wallet and metaverse

According to Visa's filings, the firm is contemplating a ""cryptocurrency wallet,"" describing it as ""software for users to view, access, store, monitor, manage, trade, send, receive, transmit, and exchange digital currency, virtual currency, cryptocurrency, digital and blockchain assets, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).""

Visa may also set up shop in the metaverse, as it is mulling ""providing virtual environments in which users can interact for recreational, leisure or entertainment purposes accessible in the virtual world.""

PayPal still working on its own wallet

PayPal's trademark application mentions ""crypto"" 18 times, beginning with ""downloadable software for sending, receiving, accepting, buying, selling, storing, transmitting, trading and exchanging digital currency, virtual currency, cryptocurrency, stablecoins, digital and blockchain assets, digitized assets, digital tokens, crypto tokens and utility tokens.""

PayPal already allows its users to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Litecoin (LTC), and send it to wallets elsewhere, but it is clearly still building out its own crypto wallet.

Western Union going bigger on digital currency

Western Union's filing appears to cover every aspect digital payments, including ""the management and maintenance of digital currency and electronic wallets."" Like the others, WU plans ""downloadable software for generating cryptographic keys for receiving and spending cryptocurrency.""

Despite the protracted crypto winter, crypto trademark filings have been flowing steadily for some time, as noted by trademark attorney Mike Kondoudis on Twitter, including by Viking Cruises, and cosmetics retailer Ulta last week.

To be sure, trademark filings are often defensive legal actions, and don't guarantee that the covered products and services will actually be developed and sold. But they do demonstrate that a company recognizes a potential future market and wants to be prepared to enter it.

In October alone, Web3 and NFT filings have emerged from brands as diverse as musical instrument maker Fender, food giants Del Monte and Kraft (regarding its iconic Wienermobile), burger chain Inn-N-Out, snack maker Takis, wine and spirits company Moët Hennessy, auto racing firm Formula One, online betting platform DraftKings, and singer Lizzo.

NFTs and digital goods and collectibles appear to be the hottest category among potential areas of interest for American businesses. So far this year, more than 6,300 U.S. trademark applications have been filed for NFTs and related items, Kondoudis reported, compared to only 2,100 applications in all of 2021.

For the broader digital currency and cryptocurrency space, 2022 has seen over 4,300 U.S. trademark applications, compared to 3,500 in 2021.","In a striking counterpoint to the heightened crypto skepticism during the current bear market, financial services giants Visa, PayPal, and Western Union were among the notable firms that filed new trademark applications involving crypto and Web3 related products and services in the past week.

Santiment says that Shiba Inu is starting to gather some momentum after displaying strength in its Bitcoin pair (SHIB/BTC).

“Whatever side of the fence your on with memecoins like DOGE and SHIB, there is no denying that they have had their pump moments. Shiba Inu has historically followed Dogecoin pumps. Watch trading volume on our chart.”

According to Santiment’s chart, Shiba Inu bulls are showing signs of life as the SHIB/BTC pair witnesses a significant rise in volume, suggesting that traders are betting on the meme token outperforming Bitcoin.

At time of writing, Shiba Inu is changing hands for $0.000013, up over 8% on the day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading a $20,800, up a little over 1% in the past 24 hours.

In addition to crypto traders, blockchain tracker WhaleStats shows that the largest 5,000 Ethereum whales have also been accumulating SHIB over the last few days. According to WhaleStats, the top 5,000 ETH whales hold over $94.2 million worth of SHIB, an increase of 4.5% from their Shiba Inu trove of $89.7 million, which was recorded on Friday.

Looking at Bitcoin itself, Santiment reveals that long-term bulls continue to stash away the largest crypto by market cap as BTC supply on crypto exchanges plummet to a level last seen in November 2018.

“With Bitcoin back above $20,700, traders appear to be content with long-term holding as coins continue moving away from exchanges. With the ratio of BTC on exchanges down to 8.3%, it’s the lowest seen in four years. October has been a big outflow month.”

2022-10-31 08:59:46.705749,Tech Xplore,Annual tech gathering takes aim at crypto,"Guests include speakers as varied as linguist Noam Chomsky and champion boxer Oleksander Usyk.

One of the world's biggest technology get-togethers kicks off in the Portuguese capital on Tuesday, with organizers saying a key aim is to ask tough questions about cryptocurrencies.

Around 100,000 people are expected to gather in Lisbon for the four-day Web Summit and related events, the first full-scale edition since 2019 following the disruption of the pandemic.

The conference attempts to bring together start-ups, investors, business leaders and agenda-broadening speakers –- linguist Noam Chomsky and heavyweight boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk are among this year's lineup.

Several of the prime slots, though, are taken by cryptocurrency specialists led by Changpeng Zhao, boss of crypto exchange Binance.

And plenty of companies present—from start-ups to billion-dollar behemoths Yuga Labs and OpenSea—are promoting the technology that fans claim will be the future of the web, gaming and ultimately the entire financial system.

But crypto has so far been derided as a tool to generate investment bubbles, hide illicit wealth and enable scams.

Conference organizer Paddy Cosgrave told AFP there were ""a lot of questions to be answered"" about crypto, describing it as ""largely smoke and mirrors"".

""We've done our best to persuade many of the leading lights in the space to come, and some of them will get a bit of a kicking on stage, we'll see how that goes,"" he added.

Crypto skeptics including actor Ben McKenzie (Gotham, The O.C.) have also been given slots.

Organizers said the event's 70,000 tickets had sold out, with Cosgrave reckoning some 30,000 more people would be in Lisbon for side events.

Whistleblower focus

Zhao's company is the dominant player in the crypto sector, but it has been repeatedly accused of trying to dodge regulatory scrutiny—claims the company has denied.

And it became embroiled in one of the biggest stories of the week, with a $500-million investment to back Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter.

But the wider crypto sector is struggling with plunging values and flatlining interest from the public.

And the tech industry as a whole is also struggling with supply chain problems, trade disputes between the US and China, and economic volatility that has sent investors fleeing.

Cosgrave, though, played down any suggestion that conferences like his had a role in helping to stimulate investment or turn around the fortunes of the sector.

""It's not really about the establishment or the dominant companies of today,"" he said.

""It's a gathering of companies that in the future may play some significant role.""

As usual, though, the Web Summit will host plenty of figures from the dominant companies—Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta will all be there.

But on a lower level than last year, when the conference played host to Facebook's Nick Clegg and to whistleblower Frances Haugen, who accused their company of stoking hatred in return for clicks.

Cosgrave highlighted the event's history of giving a platform to whistleblowers—this year Mark MacGann, who revealed details of Uber's aggressive lobbying, will be giving a talk.

The organizers say more than 1,000 speakers will take part, giving talks on subjects from cybersecurity to artificial intelligence.

2022-10-31 02:59:47.340089,Forbes,What Is The Crypto Freedom PAC Planning For The Midterm Elections?,"| Getty Images

Key Takeaways

The Crypto Freedom PAC is backing pro-crypto candidates for the U.S. Senate.

Pro-Bitcoin candidates supported by the super PAC include Blake Masters, Ted Budd, and Adam Laxalt.

Wins from these pro-crypto candidates could be a good thing for the entire crypto industry, but only time will tell how the midterm elections play out.

PACs, or political action committees, can be found across the entire political spectrum. The goals of these individual PACs include raising and spending money to support the election or defeat of a particular candidate.

These organizations have the power to make independent expenditures in federal races, which can include running ads to advocate for their preferred candidate, or perhaps more common, against their political adversaries. While PACs are often bipartisan in nature, they are generally formed to advocate for specific issues.

The Crypto Freedom PAC is one of several crypto-focused PACs that have made their way onto the political scene.

What is the Crypto Freedom Political Action Committee?

The Crypto Freedom PAC was created on June 1, 2022. As the midterm elections appear on the horizon, it’s one of many PACs making its presence known.

The PAC has Adam Rozansky listed as its treasurer and custodian of record. David McIntosh is listed as the designated agent. If you see these names circulating, you’ll know they are involved in the Crypto Freedom PAC.

What does the Crypto Freedom PAC want?

The purpose of a super PAC is to spend funds in an effort to create preferred election outcomes. A super PAC is spending money in support of particular candidates. But these organizations cannot contribute directly to a candidate's campaign, which distinguishes them from regular PACs that can contribute funds to a candidate’s campaign. When the candidates they back are elected, the hope is that the super PAC’s underlying interests will be protected.

According to the Crypto Freedom super PAC’s website, it is dedicated to “helping elect candidates for congress who will fight for crypto freedom and against any government overreach of digital assets.”

The super PAC continues to clarify its mission with the following statement: “We believe the only way to protect crypto is to beat Democrats in the House and Senate this November so we can block White House regulations AND remove anti-Bitcoin Senators such as Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown from their powerful positions on the Hill. Democrats in Congress are a rubber stamp for Biden, and he’s made it clear that digital assets is [sic] in his sights if we don’t fight back.”

The Crypto Freedom PAC backs crypto-friendly candidates. Although the PAC is officially non-partisan, its efforts are more in line with some right-leaning candidates.

What actions has the Crypto Political Action Committee taken?

The Crypto Freedom PAC is relatively new, but the PAC has hit the political scene with a splash. Here’s a list of its accomplishments since June.

Spent Millions

The Crypto Freedom PAC apparently has very deep pockets. In just a matter of months, the super PAC has spent over $2.6 million. All of the spending has gone into supporting select Republican candidates.

According to Open Secrets, the super PAC spent $213,060 in support of certain Republican candidates and $2,215,869 against other Republican candidates, as of October 17, 2022. However, the midterm election cycle is still heating up. With that, it’s likely that this super PAC will continue to spend big in support of candidates with crypto-friendly ideas.

Backing Select Candidates

On the Crypto Freedom PAC website, it clearly states which pro-crypto candidates it is supporting. The candidates getting public support from this PAC include Ted Budd and Adam Laxalt, but Blake Masters, a Bitcoin investor running for the U.S. Senate in Arizona and endorsed by Peter Thiel, seems to be the primary beneficiary of the PAC for now.

During this first election cycle, it remains to be seen how effective the Crypto Freedom PAC is at assisting their candidates of choice.

How does this development impact crypto investors?

Unless you’ve been able to blissfully avoid the uncomfortable impact of politics, it’s likely that you’ve noticed that things are heating up ahead of the midterm elections. Even if your mailbox isn’t inundated with countless flyers about the different candidates, you might not be able to avoid the incessant political ads while watching TV, listening to the radio, or using the internet.

When the Crypto Freedom PAC entered the political landscape, it began to add its own take on politics to the mix. Specifically, it has gone about promoting pro-crypto candidates that could help to protect their vision of crypto’s future.

According to Bitcoin Magazine, the White House seems to have taken direct aim to create more regulations for cryptocurrencies. Specifically, the White House issued a report about the negative impacts of Bitcoin mining on the environment and suggested banning the proof-of-work process that serves as a critical component of the Bitcoin market.

The Crypto Freedom PAC is working to help crypto-friendly candidates make it into Congress. If the PAC succeeds, that could set up the cryptocurrency markets for more protection from the regulations that have been proposed.

As an investor, having crypto-friendly lawmakers in office is likely helping for your portfolio, or so the theory goes. After all, the laws of the land can change. If someone on Capitol Hill has an interest in protecting the cryptocurrency markets from interfering regulations, that could solidify the long-term future of cryptocurrency as an investment opportunity.

Bottom Line

After the recent cryptocurrency market crash, many investors are understandably wary of crypto. But the creation of the Crypto Freedom PAC and other pro-crypto super PACs has made it clear that there are players in the crypto industry with deep pockets who are prepared to spend to affect policies that will impact their interests.

As an everyday crypto investor, monitoring how these super PACs impact the long-term future of the crypto market is important. But if you don’t have the time to regularly monitor the notoriously volatile crypto market, you can harness the power of AI to handle it for you.

2022-10-31 09:59:47.364556,CNBC,"Bitcoin's break above $20,000 has investors wondering if the crypto bottom is in. Here's what analysts say","Bitcoin moved above $20,000 last week and has sustained that level since, after spending much of the month sitting idly in the $19,000 range, suggesting to some eager investors that the tide may be turning for crypto. The cryptocurrency rose for the second week in a row, by 7.25%, although in the week prior it finished higher by just 0.01%. Ether notched an up week as well, its first one in the last four. It ended 19.48% higher. The upward push came ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting in the week ahead and midterm elections that follow in the next after that. ""We have said all year that we could get positive news in November, and we believe that the FOMC meeting next week could come with positive comments ahead of the midterms about potential future rate hikes,"" said Steven McClurg, co-founder and chief investment officer at digital asset fund manager Valkyrie Investments. ""Additionally, elections bring more economic certainty, and a swing to a Republican-controlled House and Senate would satisfy the market to bring some upward momentum in risk asset pricing,"" he added. ""We are seeing a possible light at the end of the tunnel, and others are trading on these ideas."" October is a historically strong month for crypto, but this month, prices and volatility have been relatively flat. Just last week, bitcoin and ether were both down slightly for the month, but this week's rise has pushed them into the green. If prices fall again, $18,100 would be the level to watch, Morgan Stanley's Sheena Shah pointed out in a note Thursday. If they push higher, bitcoin's recent high of $22,800 would be the next stop before $25,000. ""In the short term, bitcoin may still need to shrug off the disappointment from the stock market, but the level around the $19,500 level will likely be support for the price,"" said Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese crypto exchange Bitbank. ""Bitcoin's breakout from last week's narrow range was accompanied by a substantial rise in trading volume, which, from a technical perspective, is a reliable breakout."" Don't call it a bottom yet The odd inactivity has investors wondering if the crypto market could be turning for the better and breaking out of this year's rut. It looks to many like the initial stage of a new bull run. However, there isn't enough evidence quite yet to call it, analysts say. ""In the past, when price volatility was this low, it usually meant that the downward trend was nearing its end, however, many of the on-chain metrics we have analyzed still can't confirm that the price has completely bottomed,"" said Julio Moreno, senior analyst at CryptoQuant. Not just that, investors also shouldn't rule out another big drop. Charts from CryptoQuant show that in 2018 there was a 50% price decline that followed a period of low price volatility, taking bitcoin from $6,500 to $3,200 in a period of a month, Moreno noted. Similar to this year, that event followed a bear market in which bitcoin suffered a 67% drawdown from its peak, Morgan Stanley's Shah said. It also suffered ""crypto QT"" – or what the firm has previously described as the ""crypto equivalent of quantitative tightening"" – following the decline in the Tether (USDT) stablecoin market cap. This year there's been a gradual decline in USDT and USD Coin (USDC). This week Morgan Stanley pointed out that bitcoin's 1-month realized volatility is now lower than the volatility of both the S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite – a ""rare occurrence, only seen in November 2018 and October 2016,"" Shah said the Thursday note. It's not enough, though, CryptoQuant's Moreno said. He's also looking for an increase in flows from spot exchanges to derivative exchanges. That, combined with the recent low volatility, would provide more evidence of a bottom, but bitcoin today is still leaving derivative exchanges. ""For low price volatility to be associated with bottoms, the portion of bitcoin inflows into exchanges dominated by whales ought to be relatively low,"" he said. ""In the case of the 2019 market bottom, this metric was at 68-70%, compared to about 83% currently."" CryptoQuant also analyzed bitcoin's MVRV, or market value to realized value, ratio, which shows crypto hasn't gone into undervalued territory. Additionally, long-term holders make up 80% of the cryptocurrency's realized cap, which is in line with previous market cycles' price bottoms. Both of these metrics support the idea that a market bottom is in, Moreno said.","October is a historically strong month for crypto, but this month, prices and volatility have been relatively flat.

In today’s fast-moving world where technology is at the forefront of an ever-dynamic society, online casinos have evolved. Many online gaming sites have adopted a simpler, easier, and safer mode of online casino crypto payment. The online casino industry has also seen a surge in wagers placed digitally, with this segment comprising over 40% of online wagers by 2022. Indeed, the growth in the casino market can be attributed to new technologies such as chatbots.

Annual turnover over $100 billion by 2022

Over the last couple of years, the gambling world has risen to all-time popularity. Many people have started to favor casino sites over traditional, land-based Casinos. Gambling experts estimate that by 2022, worldwide annual turnover would more than certainly reach $100 billion.

The said amount is around a third of the overall revenue produced from all gambling facilities globally. Based on this report, we may as well assume that online casinos are well on their way to becoming the gambling industry leaders in the near future. With Bitcoin games to feed the player’s risk appetite, the space is looking at a bright future.

Providers in the online gambling industry, particularly in the casino space, will increasingly offer engaging products to drive user adoption and player spending, and one survey forecasted, online gambling users, to almost double, reaching 684 million by 2022. With continuing efforts by a number of states to legalize online offerings, the North American market is ripe for future growth.

Crypto payments redefine online casinos

What does an online casino offer?

The payment methods available through the casino site are quite numerous. It is no longer news that cryptocurrencies are by far the safest mode of transaction, with a preference for Bitcoin. Bitcoin had a massive spike in value and was worth around $20,000 at its peak back in 2017. Today’s Bitcoin price is $20,527.59 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $33,184,451,514 USD.

That was an all-time high, and even though years down the line, the value had risen and depreciated significantly, Bitcoin still remains a valuable model for online casino games. The new generation of gamblers prefers a faster and more secure mode of payment rather than playing for fiat currencies, and that is what exactly cryptocurrencies offer.

Starting with instant online casinos, then came the mobile age and now the gambling industry is reigned by cryptocurrencies. As a result, Bitcoin is widely utilized as an online crypto payment. Canadian online casinos utilize the popular crypto in all their games.

Online casino crypto payments pro

One of the major advantages online casinos have over land-based casinos is their accessibility. All online casino games can be played at any time and location. All that you will require is a smart device and a good connection to the Internet. To make it even better, online casino payout rates are even higher.

To even make it better, Bitcoin has a payment medium that is fully optimized for online use. What this means for users is that every deposit and withdrawal is done instantly without any hassles. However, this is not the case with other currencies.

Another beautiful aspect of using Bitcoin is that trading with cryptocurrency helps you to maintain your absolute privacy, and this is just the case with Bitcoin. So in case you aren’t aware, online casinos make you play under aliases and encourage you to be anonymous to some degree, however, Bitcoin takes a step further.

In utilizing this cryptocurrency, you can also enhance your safety and protection at the casino sites you visit frequently. Finally, many experts believe that Bitcoin will become one of the most desired payment options for online casino crypto payments.

Words of caution

With the obvious benefits that cryptocurrency offers such as anonymity, quick deposits and withdrawals, and low fees, it is blatantly clear to see why crypto casinos are catching on fast with both gamers and operators. Words of caution though, there are plenty of great casinos out there, but there are also some scams that you need to be aware of. Pay attention to the details and look for licensing information to ensure that you’re playing on a safe and reputable platform. And if in doubt, always ask around in forums or on social media to get a second opinion.","Many online gaming sites have adopted a simpler, easier, and safer mode of online casino crypto payment.

2022-10-31 02:59:47.377772,The Daily Hodl,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Makes Crypto Adoption Prediction, Says Bitcoin (BTC) Will Become New Gold","Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is forecasting a timeline for global crypto adoption, saying that the industry is still in its very early days.

In a new episode of Coinbase’s Around the Block podcast, Armstrong says Bitcoin’s market capitalization is not yet big enough for BTC to act as a serious flight-to-safety asset that some of its advocates have been predicting.

However, Armstrong says Bitcoin will manage to fulfil the role of a “new gold” asset class within the next decade.

“Typically in down macro environments, we see there’s a flight to safety. In the traditional economy, that was always gold, commodities, things like that. But I think what we’ve realized in this downturn is that the crypto economy is just not a significant enough percentage of the global economy, the broader economy yet, to be actually treated as that digital gold in the sense that people do a flight to safety towards Bitcoin.

I think we’ll see that probably change over time. I could see in the next five or ten years as the crypto economy really becomes a bigger percentage of the global GDP that people will actually flee to Bitcoin as the sort of ‘new gold’ if you will, but that hasn’t happened yet. Frankly, I’ll admit, I overestimated the chances that Bitcoin would be this inflation hedge in this macro environment. I thought it might actually draw more attention to Bitcoin in this kind of environment, but it looks like we’re a little too early.”

Armstrong says that crypto could follow the same trajectory as e-commerce’s adoption curve.

“It’s such a good a reminder that, even 10 years ago when I started Coinbase, I thought it was super early. But even now today, it’s still super early.

It’s going to take decades for the global macro environment to start to think about the crypto economy as the main thing, and we saw something similar happen with e-commerce back 20 years ago when it first started in 1999-2000. People treated it as this sideshow, they would say ‘Ah, I’d never put my credit card into a website. It might get stolen or something.’ And here we are 20 years later and e-commerce is 15-20% of global GDP.

So I think the crypto economy will follow a similar trajectory. It just means we probably have another five or ten years to go.”

The collaboration between both locations will see them drive the adoption of BTC and other digital assets. Asides from that, both communities will also help the student thrive across the two areas. The announcement was made available on the blog post of USDT developer Tether.

El Salvador to build Bitcoin hub in Lugano

According to the announcement, the new initiative will allow El Salvador set up an office that will only be for Bitcoin. This way, the country will help the city create more awareness and adopt digital assets across Europe. Tether is also involved in the partnership as it will be charged with building a crypto hub where residents across Lugano can make daily transactions using Bitcoin and other digital assets.



The initiative is called Plan B, which will open up to users across the country. An Ambassador to the United States from El Salvador said that the whole country is pumped up about the new initiative. Ambassador Milena Mayorga also noted that Bitcoin would help residents achieve economic freedom and security, among other things.

Bitcoin adoption slowed in the country

El Salvador has been one of the most vocal countries when it comes to the adoption of Bitcoin. The country installed the leading digital asset as its means of legal tender last year. During that period, the government made some of its biggest digital asset purchases. The country also made a law that created a law mandating businesses and investments with the means to accept payments in digital assets. Aside from those, the government has also held several summits for digital assets and blockchain. Despite the widespread approval from the general public, the United States leadership has been skeptical about the move.



The country claimed the movement threatened its policies as it would weaken its sanctions policy against other countries. The US also talked about how malicious actors could use the currency to carry out illegal activities. The IMF also intervened, asking El Salvador to scrap the idea citing risks to the country’s financial system. There are also claims that most of the citizens in the country are not tech-savvy, meaning that a little of the population is using digital assets for several activities.","El Salvador has announced that it has entered into a partnership with Lugano, a city in Switzerland, that will see them expand the reach of Bitcoin.

Representations of cryptocurrency Bitcoin are seen in this illustration, August 10, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Dado Ruvic | Reuters

Bitcoin's lack of volatility lately isn't a bad thing and could actually point to signs of a ""bottoming out"" in prices, analysts and investors told CNBC. Digital currencies have fallen sharply since a scorching run in 2021 which saw bitcoin climb as high as $68,990. But for the past few months, bitcoin's price has bounced stubbornly around $20,000 in a sign that volatility in the market has settled. Last week, the cryptocurrency's 20-day rolling volatility fell below that of the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes for the first time since 2020, according to data from crypto research firm Kaiko. Stocks and cryptocurrencies are both down sharply this year as interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve and a strengthening dollar weighed on the sector. Bitcoin's correlation with stocks has increased over time as more institutional investors have invested in crypto.

But bitcoin's price has stabilized recently. And for some investors, that easing of volatility is a good sign. ""Bitcoin has essentially been range bound between 18-25K for 4 months now, which indicates consolidation and a potential bottoming out pattern, given we are seeing the Dollar index top out as well,"" Vijay Ayyar, head of international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC in emailed comments."" ""In previous cases such as in 2015, we've seen BTC bottom when DXY has topped, so we could be seeing a very similar pattern play out here."" Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto lender Nexo, said bitcoin's price stability was ""a strong sign that the digital assets market has matured and is becoming less fragmented.""

An end to crypto winter?

Cryptocurrencies have suffered a brutal comedown this year, losing $2 trillion in value since the height of the 2021 rally. Bitcoin, the world's biggest digital coin, is off around 70% from its November peak. The current so-called ""crypto winter"" is largely the result of aggressive tightening from the Fed, which has been hiking interest rates in an effort to tame rocketing inflation. Large crypto investors with highly leveraged bets like Three Arrows Capital were floored by the pressure on prices, further accelerating the market's drop. However, some investors think the ice may now be beginning to thaw.

watch now

There are signs of an ""accumulation phase,"" according to Ayyar, when institutional investors are more willing to place bets on bitcoin given the lull in prices. ""Bitcoin being stuck in such a range does make it boring, but this is also when retail loses interest and smart money starts to accumulate,"" Ayyar said. Matteo Dante Perruccio, president of international at digital asset management firm Wave Financial, said he's seen a ""counterintuitive increase in demand of traditional institutional investors in crypto during what is a time where generally you would see interest fall off in the traditional markets."" Financial institutions have continued taking steps into crypto despite the fall in prices and waning interest from retail investors. Mastercard announced a service that allows banks to offer crypto trading, having previously launched a new blockchain security tool for card issuers. Visa, meanwhile, teamed up with crypto exchange FTX to offer debit cards linked to users' trading accounts. Goldman Sachs suggested we may be close to the end of a ""particularly bearish"" period in the latest cycle of crypto movements. In a note released Thursday, analysts at the bank said there were parallels with bitcoin's trading in Nov. 2018, when prices steadied for a while before rising steadily.

""Low volatility [in Nov. 2018] was following a large bitcoin bear market,"" Goldman's analysts wrote, adding that ""crypto QT"" (quantitative tightening) occurred as investors poured out of stablecoins like tether, reducing liquidity. The circulating supply of USD Coin — a stablecoin that's pegged to the U.S. dollar — has fallen $12 billion since June, while tether's circulating supply has dropped over $14 billion since May. Selling pressure has slowed, too, as bitcoin miners reduced their sales of the cryptocurrency, suggesting the worst may be over for the mining space. Publicly-traded bitcoin miners sold 12,000 bitcoins in June and only around 3,000 in September, according to Goldman Sachs. Wave Financial's Perruccio expects the second quarter of next year to be the time when crypto winter finally comes to an end. ""We'll have seen a lot more failures in the DeFi [decentralized finance] space, a lot of the smaller players, which is absolutely necessary for the industry to evolve,"" he added.

2022-10-31 06:59:47.829700,The Motley Fool,This Under-the-Radar Crypto Is Up 112% in the Past Month -- Here's Why the Rally Could Have Legs,"Halloween is almost here, and there's one crypto that looks like it's back from the dead -- Huobi Token (HT -2.34%), which is up 112% over the past month. This surge is particularly impressive during a challenging period for the broader crypto market.

What is Huobi Token, what's behind this rally, and why does it look like the rally could have legs?

What is Huobi Token?

Huobi Token is the native token of Huobi Global, which is currently the world's 13th-largest crypto exchange by volume, according to data from CoinGecko. Huobi Token is the 39th-largest crypto by market cap, with a valuation of $1.4 billion. As an exchange token, holding Huobi Token gives perks to Huobi users, such as lower transaction fees on the exchange.

The Huobi exchange's popularity once rivaled the likes of Binance and Coinbase Global, but China's crackdown on crypto trading was a body blow to Huobi Global, which had a large presence in China. Huobi Token reached a price of nearly $40 in May 2021, but by June 2022, it had plummeted to $4.22, due to the ban in China as well as the broader crypto market sell-off. Huobi Global and Huobi Token were in need of a catalyst, and help was on the way.

About-face

Huobi Token has staged a furious rally over the past month and has its sights set on further gains. The rebound was spurred by news that a new investor, Hong Kong-based asset manager About Capital, had acquired the company from controlling shareholder Leon Li. About Capital is led by Ted Chen, who previously started Greenwoods Asset Management, one of China's top hedge funds. About Capital vowed to invest new capital into the exchange and to work on international expansion. Chen is bullish on Huobi Global and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole, stating: ""Huobi Global offers the best of breed virtual asset investment services to millions of international users. We believe the virtual asset industry is still in its early stage and there is tremendous upside for long term growth."" This was a boon for the exchange and token, but there was more good news to come. Huobi said that as part of its international expansion efforts, it would create a ""global strategic advisory board led by leading industry figures"" and it delivered on these efforts.

The Sun also rises

One of these industry leaders that Huobi managed to recruit to its advisory board is Tron (TRX -0.97%) founder Justin Sun. Sun is one of the most high-profile investors in the crypto scene and is also reportedly one of Huobi Token's largest holders. Seventy-four million Huobi Tokens were reportedly transferred from Huobi's wallets to two wallets associated with Sun and his Poloniex exchange, so Sun is clearly motivated to see Huobi Global and Huboi Token succeed. Sun has spoken about the importance of Huobi Token as a core part of Huobi Global's value proposition and growth plans, and compared it to the integral role that Binance Coin has played in Binance's success. Sun's presence has brought significantly more attention to Huobi Token, and his extensive on-the-ground experience promoting cryptocurrency in places like South America and the Caribbean lend credence to Huobi's international expansion plans. Sun also hopes that Huobi Global will one day reenter the Chinese market, if and when regulations allow.

Interestingly, Sun also announced plans to merge the Huobi ECO chain with the Tron and BitTorrent (CRYPTO:BTT) ecosystems and pledged to invest in building all three ecosystems, although it isn't yet clear what this will actually entail.

Here's why this all bodes well for Huobi Token and its investors. If About Capital and Sun are able to execute on their growth plans, Huobi Global will gain new users, which will drive more trading volume on the exchange. This will generate higher revenue for the exchange and Huobi Global is committed to using 20% of exchange revenue to buy back or ""burn"" Huobi Tokens each quarter, similar to how Binance burns Binance Coins. Burning these tokens reduces supply and theoretically makes the remaining tokens more valuable to current holders, in a manner similar to a company buying back shares of its stock.

Ultimately, it's important to remember that investing in cryptocurrencies further down the list in terms of market cap can be a risky venture. There is no guarantee that Huobi Global's plans will succeed, and there is lots of competition in the crypto exchange market. However, for risk-tolerant investors, Huobi Token has a lot of potential. Huobi still retains some name recognition and brand value from its heyday, and this, combined with the deep pockets and big ambitions of its new backers, make it an intriguing asset with a lot of upside. If they can build out Huobi Global, it will ultimately boost the value of Huobi Token as increased revenue from more transactions will fuel the burning of more Huobi Tokens.","Halloween is almost here, and there's one crypto that looks like it's back from the dead -- Huobi Token (HT -2.34%), which is up 112% over the past month.

2022-10-31 07:59:47.843666,BeInCrypto,VC: Q3 Hits a New Low in Crypto Venture Capital Investments. Here’s Why,"VC: Galaxy Digital Research has noted in its latest report that VCs invested more than $5.5 billion in crypto businesses in Q3 2022. But, it was a new low for the year.

PitchBook noted a steep decline of over 37% in the third-quarter crypto funding against the same period in 2021. However, despite the low quarterly numbers through 518 deals, the figure exceeds the 2020 peak and the 7-year average of $3.1 billion by over $2 billion.

Lower crypto market cap accompanied by lower VC funding

Galaxy remarked that the decline is seen due to the volatile market conditions in May and June, with funds probably delaying their fall fundraising until Q4 to give the markets time to adjust.

In Q3, crypto prices also remained subdued after the total market cap hit a low in July, per CoinGecko’s quarterly report. It noted, “In Q3, it rallied up to ~$1.2T in August, before falling again to end the quarter at +6.5% or about ~$100B higher than at the end of Q2.”

“Deal activity tracks very closely to the crypto market cap,” Robert Le, fintech analyst at PitchBook, told TechCrunch. “It’s a little bit of a lag, but if you overlay the crypto market cap to the amount of venture capital going into the space by quarter or month, it tracks closely.”

For instance, Blockchain.com’s valuation has also hit a weak market environment. Despite the exchange being valued at $14 billion earlier this year, a source-based news article this week highlighted that the current round might result in a valuation of about $3 to $4 billion.

Deal count of some sectors high

Galaxy also stated, “Despite the drawdown in broader VC investing, early-stage investing remains competitive and robust. On the other hand, late-stage investing showed notable weakness potentially due to the sustained bloated valuations.”

Interestingly, the research found that in the third quarter of 2022, $1.5 billion was invested in companies created in 2018 and 2021, respectively. Companies launched in 2021 outperformed their contemporaries in fundraising and deal count, collecting $1.5 billion through 190 deals. This is in contrast to Q2 2022, when only businesses established in 2018 were the market leaders, per the report.

Although “Web3, NFT, DAO, Metaverse, and Gaming” significantly outperformed all other subsectors in terms of deal count, the report found the “Trading, Exchange, Investing, and Lending” category led in terms of total capital invested.

While it's not perfect, it's one of the most promising offerings for protecting Web3 users in existence today.

Harpie’s on-chain firewall lets crypto users connect their Web3 wallets and create a safe transacting environment and protect themselves against crypto’s most common attack vectors.

Crypto’s Security Problem

As crypto and decentralized finance have risen in popularity over the last couple of years, so have cryptocurrency-related attacks, including targeted user thefts and protocol exploits. According to Chainalysis‘ mid-year crypto crime report, over $1.9 billion had been stolen in hacks of users and services from January through July 2022, up from just under $1.2 billion over the first seven months of 2021. And while most of the exploits have been protocol-related, many users have had their wallets drained thanks in part to the risks associated with using Web3 today.

For users who regularly interact with DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces, transacting in Web3 can almost feel like playing Minesweeper in real life. Every transaction approval and on-chain interaction with a third-party application can potentially lead to wallet compromise and loss of funds. Unfortunately, there hasn’t been a simple or efficient solution to this problem so far. The most popular Web3 wallets, like MetaMask or Trust Wallet, do an abysmal job of conveying the nature of each on-chain interaction to their users. Instead of making each transaction clear, the default descriptions of most in-wallet transaction confirmations read like gibberish to most unsophisticated users, leaving them effectively blind to even the most basic security threats.

Beyond the usual protocol hacks, perhaps the most dangerous type of attacks affecting crypto users are so-called “approve spend” exploits that trick users into approving malicious transitions that allow the hackers to drain the users’ wallets. Another common way Web3 users lose their money is by having their private keys compromised, which typically involves users installing malicious software like keyloggers, storing their seed phrases in plain text on insecure devices, or falling for phishing scams.

Protecting against all of these attack vectors has always been possible, but it requires significant technical knowledge, sophistication, and sacrifices in user experience. Harpie is hoping to solve this problem.

What is Harpie?

Harpie is the first on-chain firewall solution that lets Ethereum users create a safe transacting environment by whitelisting a set of addresses and Web3 applications they deem safe. The service monitors connected wallets for pending suspicious or unpermitted transactions to stop them when they surface. When it detects a suspicious transaction, it immediately moves the user’s funds out of their wallet and into a safe, non-custodial vault, protecting the funds from potential theft.

Harpie does this by frontrunning malicious transactions by paying a higher gas fee. For example, suppose a hacker has somehow gotten hold of a user’s private keys or fooled them into approving a malicious spending transaction and tried to transfer funds from the victim’s wallet into his address. In that case, Harpie would detect the outgoing transaction from the victim’s wallet to an unapproved address, and automatically broadcast another transaction with a higher gas fee to move the target’s funds into a safe vault before the outgoing transaction is confirmed.

Ethereum validators prioritize transactions with the highest gas fees, which means they can pick up and confirm Harpie’s benevolent transactions before any attackers, thus saving users from theft.

After Harpie has intervened and moved the assets to a safe place, the user can withdraw them to a new uncompromised wallet for a flat fee of 0.01 ETH, regardless of the amount that was saved in the procedure.

How to Use Harpie

Users must connect their existing Web3 wallet to Harpie to use the service. They can do this by clicking the “Enter App” button in the top right corner of Harpie’s homepage and then clicking “Connect” inside the application. Users also need to confirm the connection inside their wallets separately to give Harpie permission to monitor their wallets and move funds from them in case of an incident.

After connecting, users are asked to set up their “Trusted Network” of applications and addresses. These are applications and addresses the users deem safe and wish to exclude from the firewall, meaning Harpie won’t automatically block any transactions with them.

To do this, users can choose if they use DeFi applications, NFT marketplaces, or both and select their trusted network of applications from a preselected list of established protocols. All of the protocols that Harpie recommends by default have undergone extensive auditing, stood the test of time, and are generally considered secure, meaning users should feel safe about whitelisting all of them. After selecting the trusted set of applications, users must press “Continue” in the bottom right corner and sign the transaction inside their wallet.

Upon signing, Harpie will start integrating its firewall system with the user’s wallet, and after it’s finished, users will be directed to their dashboard. There, they can navigate to the “My Trusted Network” tab and add all the addresses they’re regularly interacting with under the “Friends” section. These may include their own personal wallets, their friends’ wallets, and the deposit addresses of the centralized exchanges they use.

Users must also permit Harpie to access their wallet’s funds to be able to move them to a secure vault in case of an attack. They can do this by clicking “Protect” for each asset in their dashboard’s “Protected Assets” section. If they can’t see all the assets they’re holding in their wallet, they can import them manually from the same dashboard section.

Clicking “Protect” for each asset is the most critical task for every user using Harpie. This is because whitelisting a trusted network of applications and addresses only tells Harpie what traffic to monitor, whereas permitting it to access the wallet’s funds is what actually allows it to intervene and move the assets to a safe place in case of an attack.

Finally, users need to set up a withdrawal address that will have the ability to retrieve the funds moved to the safe vault in case Harpie has intervened during a security breach. They can do this by clicking on the “Setup” button in the “Setup withdrawal address” section, entering the address they want to use for retrieving funds, clicking “Register,” and then approving the action with their wallet.

It’s important to clarify that Harpie can only protect users from losing assets they already have in their wallets. If users deposit or stake their assets on a third-party crypto protocol and the application gets hacked, Harpie won’t be able to do anything to protect the users’ funds.

Final Thoughts

While no single system or protocol can solve crypto’s security problem, Harpie’s on-chain firewall approach adds an essential layer of security to the daily operations of the more active Web3 users. Beyond protocol hacks and certain edge cases, Harpie can effectively protect users against almost common crypto exploits without severely impeding their user experience.

With that said, interacting with Web3 with Harpie’s firewall solution still introduces some inevitable hindrances from a user experience standpoint. For example, users may forget to whitelist their friend’s address or their own account on a centralized exchange and have their assets automatically moved to Harpie’s non-custodial vault after they attempt to make an intentional transfer. Beyond that, Harpie also doesn’t provide users with a simple way to revoke the firewall’s access. Once enabled, users need to use a third-party application like revoke.cash to revoke the access they’ve given to Harpie if they wish to opt-out of it.

Everything considered, Harpie provides a much-needed on-chain security layer that users currently can’t find anywhere else. While Harpie is not perfect today, its solution is a clear step in the right direction toward making Web3 safer for regular users.

2022-10-31 08:59:47.856461,Bloomberg Law,,"By the time he arrived in London in January, Kyle Roche was on a roll.

Weeks earlier, his firm had scored a $100 million judgment against a self-proclaimed Bitcoin inventor, another step to break from the pack of attorneys trying to make their mark in cryptocurrency law.

Roche had also landed as a client the blockchain startup Ava Labs, paying him and his partners in digitized tokens worth millions.

Now, barely five years out of law school, the young lawyer had come to woo potential investors for a startup venture he said he was working on with Ava Labs. In one restaurant meeting, with the alcohol flowing, the lawyer touted himself as a “crazy motherf—er” when it came to court battles. He also boasted about a bold litigation strategy on behalf of Ava Labs—using investor class-action suits to weigh down their competitors.

In another private gathering that day, he crowed: “Because I sue half the companies in this space, I know where this market is going.”

What he didn’t know: His comments were being recorded.

Those conversations, including one in which Roche boasted his job included giving US regulators other “magnets” to go after, became the fuse that ignited a spectacularly swift downfall for an apparent fast-rising star in the niche field. Since videos of them were anonymously posted online in August, Roche has lost his role as a lead attorney in potentially law-defining cases, exited the firm he founded and retreated from public view.

How it happened offers a window into what can be the cutthroat nature of a fledgling trillion-dollar industry, one whose volatility has engendered a flood of lawsuits, courtroom skirmishes, and, in this case, an apparent elaborate scheme to take down a lawyer.

It’s still unclear who was behind the secret recordings or behind Crypto Leaks, the website that posted them. Roche and his former firm, in statements online and in court, have denied wrongdoing and claimed the videos were selectively edited to erase important context.

They have asserted the hidden-camera ambush was orchestrated by representatives for a Swiss blockchain firm they had sued just months before the London meetings, though they’ve not offered evidence to substantiate it.

Roche declined to comment to Bloomberg Law. But much of the story has emerged through legal proceedings, court filings, public statements and interviews, including with the prominent Norwegian investor at the center of it all.



The Crypto Lawyer

Roche’s interest in crypto took off during his first year at the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law in 2013, when he became fascinated by the legal systems surrounding currency. As a student, he collaborated with one professor on a paper touting the long-term advantages of the decentralized digital asset Bitcoin.

After graduating in 2016, he landed at the Armonk, N.Y., office of Boies Schiller Flexner, the vaunted Big Law firm, and began representing clients in crypto-related disputes.

Roche speaking at an event in 2017.

Three years later, he co-founded his own firm, one eventually filled with ex-Boies lawyers specializing in fast-developing areas like crypto. One early client, Ava Labs, even agreed to pay them with its fledgling AVAX digital tokens, which had not yet entered the market. Roche also got an equity stake in the company.

Roche and his co-founder, Devin “Velvel” Freedman, had for months worked on novel legal theories they’d argue under their new banner. Their first suit, filed in October 2019, accused the crypto exchange Bitfinex and its affiliate Tether, the company behind the Tether stablecoin, of a multibillion-dollar price manipulation scheme.

The firm later teamed with New York boutique Selendy Gay Elsberg to file 11 suits against crypto exchanges and token issuers for the alleged sale of unregistered securities.

Meanwhile, their Ava Labs bet paid massive dividends. After being introduced in 2020, the value of AVAX tokens owned collectively by Roche Freedman lawyers once reached $250 million, according to claims one partner later made in federal court.

Roche and Freedman also found the spotlight representing a client suing Craig Wright, who has claimed to be the person who developed Bitcoin. The estate of Wright’s alleged former business partner claimed it was entitled to half a cache of Bitcoin they mined together in the asset’s early years.

A federal jury in Florida cleared Wright in December 2021 of claims including fraud and theft, but ordered him to pay a $100 million judgment for the unlawful seizure of intellectual property.

Roche Freedman touted the judgment as precedent-setting. Roche would later cite the verdict to support his litigation bona fides.

“The litigation with Craig Wright put them on the map,” said Stephen D. Palley, a lawyer who has written on legal topics relating to crypto.

Weeks after that case, however, Roche took the trip that would change his fortunes.

Looking for Partners

He arrived in London hoping to line up investors for a litigation crowdfunding startup he wanted to develop with Ava Labs. Named Ryval, the venture was intended to allow people to place bets on litigation on Ava’s Avalanche platform.

On a Thursday afternoon, Roche traveled to a three-story townhouse in the city’s upscale Mayfair section that served as the office of Christen Ager-Hanssen, a high-profile venture capitalist who has reportedly made and lost millions in tech and media deals. Ager-Hanssen covered the first-class airfare and hotel costs for Roche and his fiancee, Roche would later say in a declaration submitted in court.

The meeting was arranged by an independent business consultant living in London, Ager-Hanssen said in an interview and a written statement to Bloomberg Law. The Norwegian businessman said he had never before met the consultant, who identified himself as Mauricio Andres Villavicencio de Aguilar. According to emails shared with Bloomberg Law, the consultant had first contacted Ager-Hanssen in November 2021 about coordinating a potential investment opportunity in the blockchain arena.

Ager-Hanssen said he quizzed Roche at his office for a couple hours about Ava Labs and the proposed startup. He said he did not record the meeting, or know who did, but that the video excerpts later released were from the consultant’s vantage at the table. He also said he did not go with Roche to the restaurant that night, but that the consultant did.

Christen Ager-Hanssen

Ager-Hanssen said he was intrigued by the Ryval concept, and flew to New York weeks later to continue talking with Roche and Ava Labs executives. By March, however, his interest had waned and he opted not to invest.

The startup plans lagged in the ensuing months. Roche still stayed busy, splitting his time between New York and Miami as his firm grew to more than 20 lawyers and became more active in the class-action sphere when the digital asset market plummeted.

The crash stoked a lot of scrutiny. Amid the fallout, an anonymous website emerged, promising to root out bad actors.

‘Evil Conspiracy’

Crypto Leaks announced itself in June with a website, a Twitter account, and pledges to expose corruption in the fledgling industry.

“Follow us to find out what vested interests don’t want you to know,” it said in its inaugural tweet. But Crypto Leaks hid behind its own curtain: Its domain was anonymously registered that May.

Its first two posts focused on what it called “attacks” on the Internet Computer blockchain and the once-buzzy ICP token introduced by the Dfinity Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit led by Dominic Wiliams. The digital asset quickly plummeted in value after being sold to retail investors in May 2021.

Neither of the website’s first posts got traction. Then, on Aug. 26, Crypto Leaks released its third so-called “case study.”

“Ava Labs (Avalanche) attacks Solana and cons SEC in evil conspiracy with bought law firm, Roche Freedman” blared the headline.

The post claimed to reveal “an extraordinary secret pact” between Roche Freedman and Ava Labs “that harms the crypto industry.” It described Roche as a lawyer who used the legal system “gangster style” to attack Ava Labs’ competitors, and pursue “personal vendettas” for the blockchain company’s leader.

Weaved into the text were 25 video clips of Roche speaking in two settings: at the conference table in the Mayfair office that January afternoon and in the bustling restaurant he visited later that night, in front of a plate of food and a wine goblet.

Excerpts from both showed Roche explaining his close ties to Ava Labs and his win-or-go-home approach to litigation, and at times disparaging the legal system. In one clip, he reveled in “the fact that 10 idiots control the flow of all the money that happens in American class actions.”

The Fallout

The recordings’ release sparked a quick disavowal from Ava Labs’ CEO and statements from leaders across the crypto space—both about what Roche said and whoever recorded it.

“Who’s funding all these hit pieces?” tweeted Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges.

Roche quickly denied deploying litigation as a weapon to go after Ava Labs’ competitors and vowed to fight efforts to intimidate him and his firm. But the blowback was intense. In court filings, his firm said he had received “threats of violence” in the days after the recordings were released.

Roche

Within days, Roche’s partners announced he was barred from participating in any ongoing class action. They called the move an attempt to protect the firm against appearances of impropriety.

That didn’t stifle Roche’s detractors. Lawyers for Bitfinex and Tether, defendants in a class-action suit brought by Roche Freedman, called for the entire firm to be disqualified, claiming the videos raised “grave concerns” about their motivations.

At least four defendants in other cases, including Dfinity, also brought disqualification motions against the law firm, citing Roche’s London comments as a conflict of interest.

At least one of Roche’s clients dropped him. One partner left the firm.

Ava Labs also sought to distance itself. CEO Emin Gun Sirer called the allegations of targeting competitors through litigation “conspiracy theory nonsense” and said Roche made false statements about his work for the company. By mid-September, he publicly declared that Roche no longer represented Ava Labs and that he’d relinquished his shares in the company.

The next month, Roche’s partners fought to keep the firm’s role as lead counsel in the class action against Bitfinex and Tether—a case they had been litigating for three years. They argued they were victims of a scheme by another defendant in a separate case to cripple the firm’s cryptocurrency practice.

New York Judge Katherine Polk Failla was unpersuaded, concluding that Roche’s “uniquely stupid” comments were “too detailed to dismiss” as just being “drunk and stupid.” She said she recognizes the difference between Roche and his partners, but said, “at this point in time, I have concerns about the firm as well.”

Roche, meanwhile, tried to identify his saboteur.

He publicly claimed that Ager-Hanssen had been working for Williams, the Dfinity leader. He offered no evidence to back up the claim, but in a post on the website Medium, Roche cited a 2017 article in The Telegraph, a U.K.-based newspaper, that noted Ager-Hanssen helps “eccentric billionaires” facing legal issues and that he has a history of covert recordings.

Last week, Roche’s former partners asserted in a court filing that Ager-Hanssen is a “‘conflict management’ specialist” who was hired by Dfinity to spy on Roche. The filing was made in the firm’s ongoing class action against Dfinity for alleged securities fraud and market manipulation.

“The publicly available evidence establishes” Dfinity is behind the Crypt Leaks site, the firm added, noting that on the same day the Crypto Leaks domain was registered, Dfinity’s CEO had tweeted he was “coming for’’ those who attacked the ICP token.

Neither Dfinity nor its outside counsel responded to repeated requests for comment from Bloomberg Law.

In a phone interview, Ager-Hanssen denied Roche’s accusation, claiming he’s never met Williams and that he did not know about the surreptitious recordings. He said he suspected they were arranged by the consultant. He said he has not spoken to the man since the meetings —and can’t be sure Villavicencio de Aguilar wasn’t an alias.

Still, Ager-Hanssen hasn’t shied from the attention, celebrating Roche’s downfall. “Kyle Roche dragged me into this by lying about facts,” he tweeted on Aug. 30, a day after Roche accused him of being behind the recordings.

Bloomberg Law has been unable to reach the consultant or confirm his name and occupation. Emails sent to an address he used with Ager-Hanssen and others were not returned.

The disclosure of the recordings could be in violation of privacy laws in Britain, including the 2018 Data Protection Act.

Two weeks ago, Roche’s partners severed ties with him and moved to rename the firm Freedman Normand Friedland LLP.

“We are focused on continuing to provide our clients with top quality representation and are proud of the firm’s accomplishments to date,” a spokeswoman said in their only public comment. “We wish Kyle the best in his future endeavors.”

Out On His Own

Roche has since established his own practice, Kyle Roche P.A., according to an Oct. 20 court filing. He continues to represent clients in some individual matters.

Like his ex-colleagues, Roche is vying to remain counsel in the case against Wright, which is now on appeal. Wright, too, has moved to disqualify Roche and his former firm.

It’s unclear if Roche or his former firm are taking more steps to bolster their claims that people from Dfinity were behind the recordings. But details are likely to emerge in the coming weeks; a California judge has scheduled a Jan. 12 hearing on Dfinity’s motion to disqualify the law firm from its class action case.

By then, nearly a year will have passed since the fateful trip that changed Roche’s path.

2022-10-31 03:59:47.878659,CoinGeek,‘Crypto’ law enforcement: A crossroads for digital asset enforcement and US regulators,"Enforcement in the digital-assets space faces a crossroads. Whilst the agencies governing the area vie for authority and plead for more power to act, their objectivity is being called into question, as they bleed top officials to the industry they’re charged with overseeing.

Enforcement tug-of-war

Two U.S. regulators have staked a claim over digital asset regulation. On one hand is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is responsible for securities, and while there is disagreement about exactly what qualifies as a security, digital assets such as BTC and ETH are increasingly being thought of as such. On the other hand is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which primarily has the authority to regulate commodity-based futures and derivatives markets (as opposed to spot markets). The CFTC has said it views BTC and many other digital assets as commodities, and as a result it claims regulatory authority over the trading of those assets.

As a result, digital assets are jointly regulated by two agencies. The boundaries between the authority of each are murky, but will typically turn on whether an asset is better described as a commodity or a security. This separation of responsibilities makes sense in principle if the assets and commodities remain clearly distinguishable, but inevitably leaves room for a regulatory free-for-all when there is ambiguity—Ethereum’s transition from commodity to security being a case in point.

More clarity is needed. A number of bills currently before U.S. congress seek to extend the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) authority over the cryptocurrency industry, most notably the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA) of 2022, which would give the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over digital commodities trading including spot markets and including, crucially, BTC and ETH.

The DCCPA has bipartisan support and should it pass would prove a blow to the CFTC’s main rival for enforcement authority over the industry, the SEC.

SEC chair Gary Genseler has been vocal on his belief that many digital tokens qualify as securities and thus fall under the purview of his agency, and the seeding of further ground in this jurisdictional tug-of-war, thanks to the DCCPA, would be a tough pill to swallow.

The SEC has a reputation for being more aggressively ‘anti-crypto’, so some eroding of its authority in the industry might be welcomed by exchanges and crypto advocates in the U.S. and abroad. However, speaking at a symposium hosted by Rutgers Law School and Lowenstein Sandler LLP, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam suggested that one of the main obstacles that the CFTC faces to more proactive enforcement has been that his agency lacks the oversight and surveillance authority enjoyed by the SEC. This has meant that the CFTC has had to rely on complaints and whistleblowers. The lack of those tools, Behnam bemoaned, “prevents us and handcuffs us from doing real, deep analytics about trading patterns and disruptive trading.”

The DCCPA would go some way to uncuffing the CFTC by giving it a broader scope, allowing the regulator, as Behnam said,“ a much larger glance into what does this ecosystem look like, what are the patterns we’re seeing, and what rules that we could implement to prevent these patterns from continuing.”

A side effect of the CFTC’s increased mandate may be to transfer the shackles to the SEC, however Behnam continues to dispute the “cynical view” that the agencies can’t work together in the space, insisting that the bill would simply provide clarity in the regulatory “grey areas.”

If new legislation can keep the regulators from stepping on each others toes and in the process keep any potentially ambiguous cases from slipping through the cracks, then this can only be seen as a positive step for honest actors in the digital currency space. Yet, just as this back and forth might be approaching some kind of resolution, another existential threat for the authorities is raising questions in the capital.

The regulatory revolving door

Around the same time CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam was making the case for less restrictions on enforcement power and more harmony with the SEC, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and four of her Democratic colleagues in Washington were sending out letters to both agencies, as well as five other regulators, questioning the “revolving door” of top officials and former staff members leaving federal employment to lobby on behalf of the digital asset industry.

Ironically, it seems the regulators have been haemorrhaging senior officials and top talent to the very people they are supposed to be keeping in check. All of the agencies that received the letter, including the CFTC and the SEC, have seen employees leave over the last few years to work for the crypto industry as advisers, board members, legal counsel or in-house executives.

Notable cases include former SEC Chair Jay Clayton, who has advised at crypto companies since re-joining the private sector, and former CFTC Chair J. Christopher Giancarlo, who was featured by the American Crypto Association among the ‘top 10 crypto lawyers’ in its 2020 ranking.

Of equal concern to Sen. Warren and her colleagues was the number of public employees who came from the other direction, taking government jobs after spending time in the ‘crypto’ industry.

According to a February report by the Tech Transparency Project, 235 White House, congressional and federal agency staffers have moved to or from the crypto industry in recent years, allowing the industry to “fend off regulation” and “blunt new rules.”

In the letter to the regulators, the lawmakers voiced their concerns that this excessive cross contamination between the public sphere and the crypto industry, “risks corrupting the policymaking process and undermining the public’s trust in our financial regulators.”

The letter went on to say, “Americans should be able to trust that financial rules are crafted to reduce risk, improve security, and ensure the fair and efficient functioning of the market,” and that “Americans should be confident that regulators are working on behalf of the public, rather than auditioning for a high-paid lobbying job upon leaving government service.”

The CFTC and SEC have yet to make a statement on the letter, but with tensions already high amongst authorities who continue to seek more enforcement power and clarity on their jurisdictions, the letter raises untimely questions and inconvenient truths about their independence and credibility.

The stakes are incredibly high for the digital currency industry and its regulatory future, but with lawmakers increasingly asking questions and seeking tighter controls, enforcement in the space will be under a microscope with increasing pressure for results, and the regulators must pick their path forward wisely.

2022-10-31 05:59:47.893132,Bitcoinist,Crypto Corner: The Sports Slice,"Premier League soccer is the latest sports league to go big with a new blockchain partner, as a deal seems to be on the verge of closing. Meanwhile in European football, one of the sports biggest stars has signed a new partnership deal.

There’s more sports and crypto action outside of European football, however, and that’s why we dive in every weekend with The Sports Slice. Let’s take a look at some of the biggest sports news across the globe around NFTs and blockchain technology.

The Sports Slice

Messi Signs On With Bitget

Argentinian football legend Lionel Messi isn’t new to crypto. When he signed on with Parisian club PSG last year, an undisclosed amount of PSG tokens were included in the deal. Earlier this year, Messi continued his engagement by signing a $20M deal with fan token platform Socios.

A new deal enters the fray this past week courtesy of crypto exchange Bitget. The move comes on the heels of the World Cup, the sport’s biggest event – which takes place every four years – and one that has yet to see Messi raise the trophy.

English Premier League Eyes ~$35M Deal With Sorare

Last week’s Slice covered the launch of Sorare’s new NBA fantasy beta platform. No reason to pump the brakes now, as Sorare is clearly seeing some momentum; reports have emerged over the past week that Sorare is on the verge of closing a roughly $35M deal with the Premier League, expanding the blockchain fantasy game’s dominance across the soccer vertical.

While the deal is not yet set in stone, it is reportedly near the finish line and is likely a multi-year deal that will encapsulate the league’s 20 clubs for usage rights within Sorare’s fantasy gaming platform. Additionally, it is believed that the deal is slated to replace an existing deal with ConsenSys, which was also a ‘nearly completed’ deal but one that never saw the finish line.

The English Premier League has also been in conversations with Dapper Labs.

Hong Kong Rugby Union Explores NFTs

The Hong Kong Rugby Union has opened up their own NFT marketplace, according to a press release shared with Bitcoinist. The marketplace comes courtesy of a partnership between the Hong Kong Rugby Union and NFT whitelabel platform firm NuArca Labs.

Hong Kong Rugby Union, which is the region’s official governing body for rugby, joins a growing list of reputable rugby partners for NuArca Labs, which includes the likes of Major League Rugby and Rugby League World Cup 2021.

Crypto Sponsorship Risk Level

A new report from SportsPro took a high-level evaluation at current sport sponsorship categories, landing crypto sponsors – who have been emerging into sports far and wide – as ‘high risk.’

The reasoning is sound; 2022’s bear market has seen substantial reductions in new crypto sponsor entrants compared to last year’s boom. Furthermore, bear market conditions have led to some deals dissolving, often by necessity – such as Voyager’s deals with the Dallas Mavericks and the National Women’s Soccer League, or Terra Luna’s deal with the MLB’s Washington Nationals.

However, most teams and leagues are willing to have some degree of risk in their sports sponsorship portfolio. Crypto sponsors join the likes of betting, tech, and even airline sponsors in the ‘high risk’ category.

Sports Stadiums In The Metaverse

A new deal between Warner Bros Discovery Sports and Infinite Reality looks to build out sports venues in the metaverse. It is Warner Bros Discovery’s first foray into building fandom in virtual environments targeted around sports communities in particular.

It is not, however, the firms first foray into NFTs or other web3-associated tech. In fact, quite the opposite. The parent conglomerate company oversees DC Comics, which is gearing up for Superman NFTs, as our team covered in recent days. We’ve also seen recent engagement from the Warner Bros behemoth around IP like Lord Of The Rings, and we’ve seen the firm pair up with NFT-first companies such as Nifty.

What exactly this sports-centric initiative from Warner Bros Discovery will look like remains to be seen, but sports fans should keep an eye out for new AR/VR experiences with their favorite sports coming to market in the months ahead.

2022-10-31 03:59:48.205420,Crypto News,Gala Games Crypto Price Prediction November - Calvaria P2E Game Stronger Alternative?,"Gala Games Crypto Price Prediction November - Calvaria P2E Game Stronger Alternative?

Disclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.

Gala Games token is kicking off today and has ravenously pumped over 15% in the last 24-hours. Is the play-to-earn sector paving its way to recovery?

According to Coinmarketcap Gala Games is now trading at $0.042 with a market capital of $297 million. Will Gala Games pump and what alternative options could be stronger for the remainder of 2022?

Gala Games Crypto Price Prediction

The vibrant and immersive Gala Games ecosystem is thriving today as the bulls manage to bring the price back up over $0.042.

It comes with no surprise that upon reaching a critical resistance of $0.0492 earlier today there has already been a retracement of roughly 13.1%.

GALA/USDT - Daily Time Frame.

As we can see the price of Gala Games soared all the way up to $0.049 and the daily candle now has a long wick attached to the body reflecting a great deal of selling pressure.

It is also worth noting another key data point from August where the price also got close to being overbought on the relative strength index, although, at the particular point the price was higher however had the same greedy sentiment surrounding it.

On the macro-scale Gala Games crypto is still trading in a giant falling wedge and has a key level of support at $0.03892 which it could back test one more time before potentially exploding.

A solid entry for Gala Games would have been around the 20th of October where the price was around $0.032 and was also momentarily over-sold on the relative strength index.

Now, retail traders might get tempted to FOMO and chase the green candles which could potentially lead to a big mistake.

Whilst Gala Games could deliver strong returns over the next few years (next crypto bull run) the price action could remain feeble and unpromising for the remainder of 2022 unless Bitcoin takes a serious u-turn above $30,000.

Gala Games Video Analysis

Gala Games is an exciting ecosystem and NFT platform but zooming out on the price charts still reflects that GALA is in a major downtrend and is consistently producing lower-highs and lower-lows simultaneously.

It will require a great deal of accumulation to bump the price back up again towards previous all time highs.

Calvaria Stronger Alternative?

The recent pumps from play-to-earn and Metaverse tokens reflects that there is still a huge amount of value and demand for crypto games and NFT's.

Whilst Bitcoin continues to consolidate and trade sideways, many investors are turning their eyes towards altcoins and the next potential 10x presales such as Calvaria.

Calvaria is an exciting P2E battle card game where players are able to earn and upgrade their cards to become the ultimate force on the battlefield.

What gives Calvaria so much upside potential is that it is currently in presale and has raised $817,835 during a crypto bear market.

Currently 1 USDT acquires 50 RIA tokens (the native token of Calvaria) but once the presale raises $1.35m the price will go up and 1 USDT will only acquire 40 RIA tokens.

The tokenomics are also extremely bullish and the maximum supply is a very low 1 billion tokens, this makes it possible for the price to potentially reach somewhere between $0.50-$1 depending on the success of the launch.

Calvaria also boasts many more unique selling points and has the competitive edge over other P2E battle card games. This creates more investment appetite and means there is a good chance of a 10x upon public sale.

Being an early investor can yield benefits as the price could be very low compared to when it publically launches and gets deployed onto centralized or decentralized exchanges - you can use Tamadoge as an example which recently did a 19x in a crypto bear market.

This method’s ease and rapid response have influenced the popularity of platforms such as crypto gambling sites. However, gamblers now recognize these Bitcoin gambling sites as the best option to place their wagers.

While there is a wealth of information about these platforms available online today, it is still important to conduct adequate research before choosing one. Thankfully, The top crypto gambling sites typically have similar characteristics, so players can easily detect a fake one. The following paragraphs cover everything you need to know before picking some of the best crypto gambling sites in 2022.

About The Crypto Gambling Sites Transactions, Games, and Bonuses

It would help if you learned about the deposit and withdrawal procedures before deciding on a casino platform to play on. This offer is due to the possibility that such platforms only offer withdrawal choices in your home currency, even though you may be able to deposit on them in multiple currencies.

This step suggests that even while you can use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Tether, and Doge to play and withdraw, you might not be able to start in the same currencies. Transaction costs and unforeseen losses could emerge from this. The world’s central banks and payment institutions often take three to five business days before completing the transactions. However, this duration delays deposits, withdrawals, and gambling.

The best thing about these options is that transfers proceed swiftly, especially when it’s a deposit. However, the platform may still possess excessive withdrawal times as certain casinos use simple means of processing transactions to prevent data loss.

You may cash out your winnings at the top Bitcoin gambling sites without visiting another website or platform. Payment choices are what distinguish crypto gambling sites. In contrast to a casino that only accepts fiat money, they don’t limit their customers to a small number of options.

Casino Games Are Available

Most Bitcoin casino platforms offer a wide range of games, but not all of them are available using cryptocurrencies. These games include Bitcoin slots, roulette, arcade, and table games. Moreover, see the risk and stake profiles for the different games; even though there aren’t as many Bitcoin casinos as regular ones, the available ones are a great selection of games.

Furthermore, people universally acknowledge that players prefer a casino with a wide variety of games, especially ones that offer significant jackpots. As a result, Bitcoin gambling sites feature a far more excellent selection of games with higher return percentages than conventional online casinos. Punters can also easily wager on their favorite games, including slots, blackjack, and poker.

Unique Bonuses and Incentives

Consider the rewards and bonuses that Bitcoin gambling sites offer. You must know the limitations and payout policies for games where you can wager and win prizes depending on your prediction.

Many upscale Bitcoin casinos provide you extra incentives based on how many people are betting on the odds. For instance, Real Madrid would have better reward odds if more wagers were put on Liverpool defeating Real Madrid in a football match. The top platforms may also provide additional deposit bonuses and incentives.

The best Bitcoin gambling sites allow you to grow your wealth instead of losing it. They achieve this by rewarding their customers with significant bonuses. Thanks to these advantages, you can start living a successful life and being financially successful. The following are the top bonuses offered by cryptocurrency casinos:

Bonus funds incentives exclusive to specific cryptocurrencies are offered for withdrawals and deposits.

VIP provides perks with no money down.

Bonuses for deposits

Regulation and Licensing

Even though there are many online Bitcoin casinos and cryptocurrency gambling sites, not all of them are regulated or authorized by the state. Examine customer reviews and the company’s policies before choosing the platform that best satisfies your live casino requirements.

When a forum like this is licensed, it has undergone a thorough review and audit by a regulatory body like the well-known Malta Gaming Authority or the United Kingdom Gaming Authority. This law implies that you won’t have to worry about disappearing when you add money to your platform-based digital wallet. Even when you withdraw money, your transactions are protected and kept secure.

Usability and Accessibility of Mobile Apps

Despite websites, most of the largest Bitcoin casinos and live sportsbook betting systems are often ugly and challenging to use. In addition, only a few of the best cryptocurrency sites provide a mobile app and an engaging online app.

This offer ensures greater mobility while placing bets and makes it simpler to use directly from your phone. While giving their consumers various options, the best Bitcoin casinos put the user experience first.

The top fiat sites use cryptocurrency, especially for players from nations where gambling is not allowed. Therefore, they are eligible for all the advantages and can visit online casinos securely using cryptocurrencies. Contrarily, several digital currency websites accept players from different countries and do not restrict their operations. Furthermore, punters find it easy to process transactions, whether it is deposit or withdrawal.

Closing Thoughts

There are many more reasons to consider adopting a cryptocurrency gambling site for all possible gambling operations. Furthermore, Bitcoin games and offers provide profitable cryptocurrency investment opportunities.

Additionally, you can maintain your privacy and keep a record of your transactions on the blockchain. Therefore, this implies that Bitcoin gambling sites are highly transparent and unchanging.

Svetlana Martynova, CTED’s coordinator on countering the financing of terrorism, said terror groups are using virtual assets and social media platforms to raise funds.

While organizations designed to combat terror financing like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) have released guidelines for national governments and service providers, Martynova argues that more is needed.

According to a review by the FATF in 2021, a sizable majority of countries have not implemented the FATF’s revised guidelines on the regulation of virtual assets like crypto-currencies.

Only 58 countries of 128 reporting jurisdictions have updated their regulations to meet the terror finance threat.

The problem, Martynova said, is that mapping risks and vulnerabilities has not been a priority for most countries. In order to fully comprehend the risks posed by virtual assets, national governments, civil society and the private sector have to be in constant dialogue.","Terror groups like ISIL and Al-Qaeda have become particularly skilled with the use of crypto currencies to fund terrorist activity, said a key official at the UN counter terrorism executive directorate (CTED).

2022-10-31 08:59:48.236493,PYMNTS.com,"Crypto’s Growing Pains: Security, TradFi Embrace","Crypto, which was born during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, is about to see how it handles the next one.

That is something Michael Gronager, CEO of blockchain data firm Chainalysis, finds very interesting, he told PYMNTS recently.

“The idea was, basically, to build this very transparent value transfer network — non-censorable, everyone had access, very open and so on,” he said. Fourteen years later, he added, “here we are again.”

The first cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was very much a response to the sub-prime mortgage crisis and what its anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, saw as the corrupt behavior of the traditional financial system and the complicity of the governments and regulators that were supposed to be overseeing them. The very first bitcoin block mined on Jan. 3, 2009, had a note attached that cited a headline from that day’s Times of London as a sort of timestamp — pointedly, it was about a British bank bailout.

Gronager, whose firm specializes in tracking cryptocurrency transactions along the blockchain, often for law enforcement investigators or companies chasing stolen funds, said that “the initial thoughts around crypto were that this is behaving like gold, digital gold.”

That argument was widely embraced for several years, until it became clear that bitcoin and the broader crypto market was following the stock market — particularly tech stocks — and was “driven by a lot of the same mechanics,” Gronager said.

“So, when the market took a correction on its traditional financial side, we also saw correction in crypto, which to me almost indicates that it wasn’t really a crypto crash, it was just a market crash,” he said. If crypto got hit harder, he suggested, part of it was that people who had both needed liquidity quickly, and crypto provided that.

Gronager also said that looking at the crypto market will show that while small retail traders might be selling, “traditional big holders, they actually buy the dip. People who’ve been long in crypto and still have high conviction and they’re actually buying more.”

Maturing Markets

One big difference, he added, is that the crypto market is a lot more mature than during previous bear markets, such as 2013 and 2018.

The crypto market had a lot of problems at those times, Gronager noted, “There was hardly proper compliance. There was concern around criminal activity. The companies in the space were relatively small” and there was very little participation from traditional financial firms.

“If you look at it today, you will find big payment companies have entered the space” like Block and PayPal, even traditional financial firms like Bank of New York Mellon, Gronager pointed out. “That’s a big, a big change — a lot of the problems that needed solutions have been solved over the last 10 years or more specifically over the last couple of years.”

At the same time, he added, crypto is now seen as not just a payments instrument competing with credit cards and NFC payments, he said.

“What people have realized is that there are so many other opportunities in the crypto space in terms of building other financial instruments … that’s more likely an area for growth than in the payment industry,” Gronager said. “I still think payments are important, and I would probably say the most important payments where crypto is being used today is clearly in remittances and cross-border transfers, where there’s a lot of friction.”

Stablecoins Now

Still, the problem with crypto payments, Gronager said, is that if you’re a retailer and want to buy things or get a salary paid, you probably want an instrument that’s tied to how you pay taxes — a national currency.

“Basically, you want to use a stablecoin or CBDC,” he said, referring to central bank digital currencies. “There’s not really a lot of use cases that are not solved” by those digital currencies.

That said, one big difference between the two is that stablecoins have been among the fastest-growing and most-traded assets in the crypto space, while CBDCs don’t really exist yet, other than a few small, fledgling ones, he said. (Although the eventual launch of China’s digital yuan will change that.)

As for stablecoins, Gronager said he views them as “tokenized dollars,” which both makes them very strong and “paves the way for tokenizing other assets.”

While stablecoin regulation has become a key focus of governments, regulators and elected officials over the past couple of years, that it something, he said, that the crypto industry “has been longing for.”

By regulating something, Gronager said, you are endorsing it. “You’re basically saying, this is accepted,” he added. “This is something we do, this is how we do it, and these are the common rules” so companies “know what they can do and how they can best operate.”

Pointing to New York’s BitLicense — which was very unpopular in the industry due to the difficulty of meeting its requirements — Gronager said it nonetheless made New York “the biggest center for crypto worldwide.”

A Long Slog

As for U.S. regulation, Gronager suggested that he thinks it might take longer than some people in industry hope, despite talk of a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework being passed next year.

“I was part of a lobbying group around the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering directive” in the EU, he said, noting that building a proper regulatory framework started in 2015. “It took four to five years before anything actually became law and rolled out.”

One of the areas most in need of regulatory clarity, he said, is whether cryptocurrencies are securities and how that classification is defined. That has been a big bone of contention, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) saying nearly every cryptocurrency except bitcoin is a security, and the industry arguing that they are more like commodities.

“It’s still somewhat of a gray area and it’s something that needs more clarity,” Gronager said, adding that from his perspective “if you look at underlying protocols like bitcoin, like ethereum, like other things, I would clearly call them commodities more than securities.”

But it very much depends of the underlying use cases of the tokens associated with any particular project, he added. Which is exactly what the broader crypto industry says, and what the SEC currently disagrees with.

Settling this question “is not close,” Gronager predicted, saying it hasn’t mattered much in traditional finance because there weren’t “a lot of securities that were, I would say, accessible by a huge crowd of investors,” in the way that cryptocurrencies are.

Another big area of regulatory focus is and needs to be decentralized finance, or DeFi, he said.

Follow the Money

Gronager’s firm recently called 2022 the biggest year for crypto hackers yet, noting that more than $3 billion has been stolen — the vast majority of it from “bridge” projects developed to facilitate cross-blockchain payments.

These bridges, he noted, automate the process of changing one cryptocurrency to another without having to go actually trade it on an exchange. They do this by locking crypto into a wallet that lets users take out another cryptocurrency for a specific transaction, and then return it in exchange for their original tokens.

North Korean hackers have taken particular advantage of bridges, he said, noting that they are thought to be behind more than $1 billion in thefts.

“What’s happening here is, of course, it’s new technology being rolled out” mainly in 2021 “when the market was growing like crazy,” Gronager said. “When things grow very, very fast, people become very focused on getting things to market very fast.”

When that happens, “the risk of making mistakes, not having audited the code enough, not having thought [the project] through well enough” increases, he said. “Certainly you will see hacks.”

What is needed, Gronager said, is not just better security for those projects, but “better ethics around ensuring that security is high.”

Say Freeze

At the same time, he said, with proper investigations into these cases, freezing of stolen funds is possible.

Chainalysis is typically “able to reach out to our networks of crypto exchanges when hacks happen and freeze funds,” he said. “When funds are frozen in an exchange, they can actually be given back to the project from where they were stolen. And at the same time, it disables the hackers from actually [off-ramping] the funds.”

Pointing to the $625 million Ronin Network bridge hack in March, Gronager said that about 10% has been recouped and paid back to the victim.

“The majority of the funds still haven’t been laundered,” he added. “They still sit on the blockchain and can’t be moved because we are on the loop. If they move into an exchange, they might get frozen. So it’s very hard for the hackers to move them from there. So things are being done in this space to prevent it, but it has been a bad year.”

At the same time, he pointed back several decades to the rollout of Windows 95, which was on almost every computer.

“If you just opened an email — not even opening it, just looking at the preview of the email, your computer could get hacked,” Gronager said. “Suddenly your computer could be taken over, some of these hacks could actually ruin your hard drive, they could steal important information.”

What that did not do, he added, was stunt the growth of the internet.

“At the same time as the internet was growing, a lot of companies were building security,” like anti-virus scanners, he said. “Today the operating systems are far more stable, far more secure than they were in the late ’90s and early 2000s.”

That is where the crypto industry is today, Gronager said.

“The technology is young,” he said. “It's less than 10 years old for the most part. And it’s still being hardened by the day.”

,Yahoo News,What are zombie cryptocurrencies? 10 'undead' crypto tokens left on the shelf,"Meet the zombies of the crypto world: Zombie cryptocurrencies are tokens that have sat on the shelf without being traded for months. Photo: Getty

Zombie cryptocurrencies are tokens that have sat on the shelf without being traded for months. But in the current bear market, these cold assets are on the increase.

Yahoo Finance UK took a look at some of the thousands of cryptocurrencies that are not technically dead, but not quite alive either.

There are around 12,100 crypto tokens that have effectively ceased trading this year, according to a report from data provider Nomics.

Check: Crypto live prices

These assets without a pulse are the abandoned victims of investors who have lost interest as the market downturn in crypto intensifies.

Most zombie tokens were given the breath of life amid the retail mania of 2020 and 2021, but hype has an expiry date and as caution dominated investor behaviour and traders began to avoid risky assets amid the current macroeconomic headwinds, unnecessary assets were dumped and forgotten.

Watch: 'Bitcoin will eat into global finance until it's $1m per coin' | The Crypto Mile

The rise of zombie crypto tokens is a result of the digital aspect of blockchain technology — there is no cost in creating a new token and the open-source code can be copied and pasted and allowing for a multitude of new varieties of coins.

There is also little to no regulatory cost in issuing new crypto tokens, and no limit to the warehouse for dead tokens.

The combined market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies fell from a height of nearly $3tn (£2.7tn) in November 2021 to a current value of around $1tn.

As capital has haemorrhaged from the crypto-market, the liquidity for new and existing projects has dried up, making it difficult for the tokens connected to crypto projects that have genuine use cases to be traded, affecting the viability of these projects to sustain their operations throughout the year.

Here is a list of Zombie cryptocurrencies — cryptos with low to zero trade volumes — courtesy of data from livecoinwatch.com.

Bitcoin private, or BTCP.

1. BTCP

Bitcoin private (BTCP-USD) was a fork between bitcoin (BTC-USD) with a merger to ZClassic, a privacy-centric cryptocurrency, which aimed at creating a new version of bitcoin that was capable of anonymous transactions.

Story continues

The bitcoin fork — a new version of the blockchain — began with some hype as traders bought into the new token. But this soon dissipated, leaving the volume of trade of bitcoin private almost negligible.

Some exchanges list bitcoin private, although it trades at extremely low volumes.

On the BTCP Reddit page, the last entry does not bode well for those who still hold on the token and hope for a jolt of life to animate it.

Posted two years ago, the last post stated: ""I just made another loss with BTCP, I have lost $10k so far. I sent emails to everybody no answer I asked for help by tweeting BTCP, but none of the developers ever reply to me. BTCP is pumping to dump please be careful.""

HappyCoin (HPC)

2. Happycoin

The last reported happycoin (HPC) price was $0.0124. Happycoin's yearly trade volume is unknown.

It has a circulating supply of 605,858,930,040,090 and max supply of 1,000,000,000,000,000. happycoin is now only traded on one exchange, YoBit.

The happycoin website states: ""Happycoin for happy life. Happycoin is a digital currency designed for use of peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority; managing transactions and issuing money is carried out collectively by the network.""

On its Youtube channel, the last video was uploaded nearly one year ago.

Avocado Toast Finance

3. Avo (Toast.Finance)

Avo's Twitter account was last active in November 2020, and it states that the crypto-project started with the house and avo tokens and then added eggs and toast tokens.

The Twitter (TWTR) account says: ""This is a community project!""

One year ago on the Toast.Finance Reddit one user wrote: ""What happened to the price yesterday? Total rugpull? New contract? Down 100% and no comments on this on twitter?""

Wolfcoin.com

4. Wolf

The wolf cryptocurrency is connected to a trading platform that offers data, and crypto community resources. The Twitter page associated with the coin states that it is a ""utility coin that is optimised for men’s lifestyle"".

The last tweet on the page suggests a rallying cry for a community that may have long abandoned the project, it said: ""Having the courage to take the steps we always wanted to take is the only way of showing that we trust in wolfcoin.""

The Bearcoin crypto currency

5. Bear

Bear (Bear-USD) Coin is a cryptocurrency designed to help animals through decentralised fundraising and blockchain solutions.

Its website says it works in cooperation with NGOs and animal lovers around the world.

Four months ago a Reddit user asked, ""what happened to bearcoin in 2017-2019?""

He added: ""I had a random memory of a bear talking about his own crypto that I think was given based on how active you were in some way?

""Could be wrong about how it worked but I can’t find anything on it now. I know it was a few years ago. Just looking for more info to see if this was real/what happened or if I’m losing my mind.""

Marmite token

6. Marmite

The marmite ($MARMITE) cryptocurrency is a low market cap token with a low 24-hour volume of $116.

It has a total supply of 100,000,000,000 $MARMITE. $MARMITE reached its all-time high on 16 March 2022 when it was trading at $0.000002.

The marmite founder posted a 'ask me anything video' on Youtube in March 2022. The coin has seen little activity since that time.

Ick Mask cryptocurrency

7. Ick

$ick mask (ICK) is currently ranked as number 19,547 cryptocurrency by market cap. On Monday it was trading at $281. The trade volume in the last year has been negligible. $ick mask reached its highest price on September 20, 2020, when it was trading at its all-time high of $ 904.58.

Steak Token

8. Steak

The price of steak token is $0.003846 per coin. Steak token is now worth far below its all-time high of $22.62.

In the last 24 hours, steak token had a trade volume of $4.72. The Steak Network, which is linked to steak token states on its website that, ""using steak token on the Steak Network, users can trustlessly share proof of steak, knowing for certain that the steakchain is exclusively made up of verifiably rare, or medium-rare, pictures of steak"".

Safu Token

9. Safu

According to Livecoinwatch, the safu cryptocurrency had a trade volume of $5.00 in the past 24 hours.

This is extremely low activity when compared to blue-chip cryptocurrencies that see 24-hour trading volumes in billions of dollars.

Alpha

10. Alpha

Alpha (ALPHA-USD) is an ERC-20 token, deployed on the Ethereum network. It is a governance token for the Alpha Venture DAO, decentralised autonomous organisation.

Alpha Venture DAO state on their website: ""Our innovations have extended into an expansive ecosystem of products.""

Nick Gauthier, co-founder at Nomics, said that most zombie projects are related to meme coins, small personal projects, and short-term leveraged assets.

But the data also revealed that even assets that are currently trading have a slowing heartbeat, with trade volume on exchanges diminishing.

The data provider showed that most of the thousands of cryptocurrencies in existence will go through a whole day with no trading volume.

Jacob Joseph, a research analyst at researcher CryptoCompare, told Bloomberg: “During the bull market of 2021, there was plenty of money, attention, and liquidity for new and existing projects.

“However, in the ongoing bear market, even good projects with utility will struggle to sustain their operations as they lose access to capital and funding.""

Crypto investor Aaron Brown told Bloomberg: “There’s no storefront to board up, no inventory to sell, no employees to claim unemployment.

“Just people lose interest in a token and move on to other things.”

“Since the cost of a crypto startup is close to zero, and anyone in the world can try without discrimination or regulation, lots of people will keep trying.

“Where do you think the dead coins are piling up? It’s not like cyberspace is a warehouse with limited capacity.”

Most of the daily trade volume in the cryptocurrency market is dominated by the major blue chip cryptocurrencies.

Correlating almost in lockstep with markets such as the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), bitcoin's (BTC-USD) dominance of trade stood at 38.5% on Wednesday.

Ethereum's (ETH-USD) share was at 16.3%, according to CoinGecko which tracks 13,190 cryptocurrencies.

2022-10-31 00:59:48.252886,The Coin Republic,"Unmatched Crypto Picks: Uniglo.io, Algorand and Flow","While many investors new to the crypto space often focus on more well-known tokens like Ethereum and Bitcoin, there’s a lot more upside if you think outside the box a little. While it’s understandable to target these tokens, they might not necessarily be the options that give you the best ROI over the next few months.

And experts like the look of three lesser-known crypto projects. They’ve picked Uniglo, Algorand, and Flow as key options for your portfolio. Each could be exactly what your portfolio needs to succeed well into the future. Here’s why:

Uniglo (GLO)

Uniglo is arguably the best new token ever to hit the market, and it’s still available at discount prices for a few more weeks. This gives you a perfect chance to solidify your investments and prepare them for growth when GLO hits the mainstream. With the most unique set of deflationary measures ever seen in crypto, investors in GLO get total peace of mind and a base price they can have complete faith in, thanks to an utterly diversified store of value in the GLO vault. This comprises assets like gold and NFTs and ensures the system is protected against over-speculation or price dumps. GLO is geared up for success, so it should be a part of your portfolio.

Algorand (ALGO)

Algorand is expected to be a considerable part of the future of DeFi. It has created a highly scalable blockchain that unites digital and traditional finance to create the next generation of investment solutions for users. It’s got critical upsides compared to many other investments, so it could be a good time to invest for the coming months.

Flow (FLOW)

While FLOW’s blockchain platform might not be as well-known as many other projects in the space, it’s still got strong potential. FLOW has room to grow as a decentralized network that harnesses the power of the community. And if you invest right now, you could enjoy a big part of that growth.

Conclusion

FLOW and ALGO are both great picks for your portfolio right now. But they aren’t as strong an option as GLO, which has some of the best credentials the space has ever seen. So now is the time to invest.

2022-10-31 05:59:48.565904,CryptoSlate,"Op-ed: Is SBF a superhero, villain or simply misunderstood by the crypto community?","FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is a controversial figure in the world of crypto, perhaps the most contentious following his recent statements on regulation. Over the past year, SBF has been in the trending section of CryptoSlate’s people directory almost weekly.

SBF, along with his companies Alameda Research and FTX, bailed out both BlockFi and Voyager following the collapse of Terra Luna. He also engaged with Celsius but chose not to invest in them due to holes in the balance sheets to the tune of $2 billion.

Through these activities, a few have hailed SBF as the savior of crypto, while others have pointed to possible personal motivations for his actions. The founder of Solana-based Solend, Rooter, called SBF “a profit maxi: profit at all costs.”

Below I attempt to address ‘What is SBF’s position on regulation?’ and whether he has been misunderstood.

Crypto regulation and SBF

Questions about SBF’s motivation for his public views on crypto regulation have been riding high over the past few weeks. SBF’s comments on DeFi revolved around blocklists, sanctions, consumer protection, hackers, and licensing for DeFi protocols. Most notably, SBF contended that marketing DeFi products to U.S. retail investors would likely require a license and KYC obligations.

Directly, SBF remarked,

“If you host a website that makes it easy for US retail to connect to and trade on a DEX, you would likely have to register as something like a broker-dealer.”

The crypto community is not on board with the requirement of licenses and KYC checks for DeFi, as Erik Voorhees from Bankless wrote in a recent blog post. CryptoSlate covered the response alongside Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy’s take on the situation. Fortune.com referred to the debate as “the battle for crypto’s soul” while describing SBF as “the most powerful man in crypto.”

The dispute spilled over onto Twitter on October 20 when SBF responded by remarking that “he did not feel heard” by Voorhees.

From your original post, it isn't clear where/how you draw the line. I think this is why so many have been upset about. ""Everyone should respect OFAC’s sanctions lists"" Everyone? Every American or all humans? Should a protocol developer from Japan be blocking all Iranians? — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) October 20, 2022

The outcome of the social media sparring match was the pair appearing on the Bankless YouTube channel during a livestream to discuss the issue face-to-face. The conversation is the first high-level public debate between two key industry personalities not to be beholden to 280 characters. As such, it could be viewed as an accurate representation of the significant aspects of the debate.

The conversation was extremely productive and addressed the root of much of the controversy. The following breakdown highlights the major aspects of the discussion and the crucial factors that affect the rest of us in the crypto industry.

SBF on crypto regulation

At the start of the Bankless livestream, SBF directly addressed whether crypto should be regulated. His response began by saying that “parts of it should be and parts of it shouldn’t.”

Several times SBF stipulated that “the details are in the nuances” of the debate. Speaking on nuance, SBF contended there to be two axes by which the community should address crypto regulation.

“How regulated crypto should be” “How thoughtful are we about which parts of it are regulated?”

SBF commented that it is the second axis he cares about the most, giving the example of stablecoins to support his argument. Many have questioned the legitimacy of Tether’s holdings over the years, and some form of oversight as to whether a stablecoin is fully backed is a necessity in SBF’s mind.

The FTX CEO went as far as to say that there should be “really thorough regulation confirming the number of dollars in the bank account is at least as many as the number of tokens.”

However, SBF argued that making a simple transaction in a store using a stablecoin should not require regulatory oversight through a “broker dealer,” a point he viewed as “very important.”

Labeling it as his “core thought,” SBF posited, “We should be really thoughtful about where the regulation comes in and what it does.” He believes that regulation is coming to crypto in the United States, and the debate should focus on which parts should be regulated, not whether they should be regulated at all.

SBF confirmed that he believes that “some of this regulation is definitively good… and it is not just a compromise.” Further, he reasoned that he is “cautiously optimistic” about any upcoming U.S. regulation on crypto.

“I’m optimistic that it will end up striking a balance where it will do a good job of providing a large ratio of customer protection to restriction of commerce.”

Erik Voorhees on crypto regulation

Erik Voorhees replied that requiring stablecoin providers to disclose their exact holdings would be a “higher bar than the Federal Reserve itself already applies.” Unlike the traditional banking system, the crypto industry already uses cryptographic proofs throughout its ecosystem.

“The crypto industry already have a higher standard of what constitutes knowledge, what constitutes proof and so it is a little ironic for people from the traditional financial world imposing on us the need to be proving anything.”

Voorhees contended that crypto is already “heavily regulated” and is subject to laws worldwide. He asserted that it would be his “panacea” for it not to be regulated but that this is not the case, referring to it as “encumbered.” Regulations are a significant factor in the state of traditional finance and the imbalance of the “status quo,” according to Voorhees.

Progressing his argument, Voorhees noted that the industry must ask itself if it wishes to move closer to the traditional world or to build something better. Voorhees believes that transparency within the current financial system is insufficient and asked, “why are we being burdened with additional requirements for transparency when we’re already more transparent.”

Regarding regulation at a high level, Voorhees took a strong stance stating that.

“The moral premises under which these regulations get imposed on us are important. They’re always cast down as if we have these morally prescient individuals in the government that know what’s right and wrong.”

This sentiment is one Voorhees wishes to challenge as the crypto industry is building “more virtuous financial systems than what exists today.”

The DeFi debate

SBF responded to Voorhees by agreeing that some of his posts may have included at least some “lazy choice of wording.” He agreed that DeFi is more transparent when it is entirely on chain but that companies like Celsius were much less regulated and transparent. SBF also clarified that by using the word ‘everyone,’ he meant ‘everyone in the U.S.’ and everyone around the world – a question raised in Voorhees’ original response.

SBF proclaimed,

“I would be excited to see bilateral engagement around ways that we can minimize the amount of collateral damage dealt while making sure to sanction terrorist activity.”

Voorhees level-headedly replied by requesting that OFAC sanctions related to crypto activity come with official “allegations” rather than a direct decree. OFAC sanctions do not require supporting evidence, and DeFi protocols may be required to censor addresses without knowing the exact reason why.

For example, rather than banning crypto use in North Korea, Voorhees argued for more crypto usage in the country to help its citizens break free of financial tyranny.

Voorhees summarized his position on how to engage with governments on crypto regulation by asserting that.

“My ask is that people like Sam who are engaging [with the government] be very careful about what they ask for and where they draw the lines.”

SBF’s opinion that crypto should “remain open and immutable” is one that Voorhees agreed on. However, SBF’s proposal that the front end of DeFi protocols like Aave should perhaps be regulated as a financial institution is where he drew the line.

The FTX CEO denied the assertion that he believes DeFi should be regulated in such a way, stipulating that “a lot of this is just permissionless code.” Therefore, SBF hopes that any U.S. regulations are a “light touch” on DeFi.

However, SBF sees the need for DeFi regulation when currently regulated financial entities like “Schwab” decide to offer DeFi products to its customers.

SBF confirmed that he thinks the most critical aspect of DeFi is that permissionless on-chain code, smart contracts, payments, and validators should be free of regulation, going as far as to call them “sacred.” He is willing to “compromise” on regulation to keep these things free of regulation by accepting regulation for front-end DeFi services. SBF then gave an example definition of an entity subject to regulation based on this compromise.

“A website hosted on a centralized service by an American that targets financial products at American retail back ending on to DeFi but is non-custodial.”

Voorhees responded to SBF’s suggestion by claiming that “the tendency of the regulators is to make the world a darker place no matter what” and that SBF is compromising too readily. His libertarian views appear at odds with SBF’s arguably pragmatic approach to regulation at a fundamental level.

Since the days of Satoshi, the crypto industry has focused solely on a financial system free of regulatory oversight by governments. Voorhees remains true to this vision in his rebuttals toward SBF. However, at this point, does the debate not reduce to a discussion on political grounds rather than objective profiteering? The crypto community is unsure.

Online perception of SBF

A clip of the discussion has been circulating on Twitter in which one Bitcoiner, Duo Nine, asserted, “This guy does not deserve what crypto has to offer. I’d be very careful about anything this guy touches.” The clip shows SBF failing to assert a reasonable rebuttal of Voorhees’s argument that censoring DeFi would be akin to censoring e-mail in the late 90s.

SBF stutters and fails to find the words to respond during the clip, and it ends with a comedy outro mimicking the Larry David show Curb your Enthusiasm. However, the podcast continued at this point, and SBF did find words to showcase that he understood Voorhees’ point of view, as stated earlier in this article.

Wait till the end. 👇#FTX CEO has lost the plot IMO. This guy does not deserve what crypto has to offer. I'd be very careful about anything this guy touches. He should not do interviews either. 😅 pic.twitter.com/a9zs0Jw8va — Duo Nine | YCC (@DU09BTC) October 29, 2022

A source familiar with the matter who asked to remain anonymous stated that the discourse around SBF has been “overblown” and is not in keeping with their experience of the FTX CEO. However, the source confirmed they had many trader friends who “dislike him and avoided trading on FTX as long as possible.”

During the livestream, SBF mirrored the above sentiment, claiming that others have been “misrepresenting pretty grossly what my position is, and I feel like I never said that” in response to a question on the need for compromise in the user interface of DeFi.

SBF confirmed that it is possible that the crypto industry may have to compromise on some aspects of regulation relating to the front end of DeFi protocols that interact with users inside the U.S. However, he also affirmed that he is “not saying thatwe should make happen… those I think would be probably not the right tactics.”

My take on the situation

From his conversation with Voorhees, it is hard to argue that SBF has malicious intent, as he continuously admitted to not knowing if he is correct and was firm that many aspects of crypto are “sacred.”

It is my view that SBF has made suggestions on compromises that could be made to keep on-chain transactions free of regulation that are now being taken as evidence he wants DeFi to be fully regulated.

Whether SBF’s public comments truly reflect his private actions remains to be seen. Yet, while I may not agree with everything SBF has said, I also do not agree with everything Voorhees expressed.

The issue is nuanced, and it is important to ensure an understanding of the opposing viewpoint before going on the attack. Regulation is coming to crypto, and the battlefield requires everyone in the crypto industry to engage in intelligent debate. Infighting will not lead to a revolution in the financial system, but considered civil discourse has a shot.

Thus, it appears that the jury is still out on SBF’s role in the crypto industry. Some view him as the savior following his bailouts of Voyager and BlockFi, some believe he has ulterior motives for personal gain, and others contest that he is simply misguided.

The topic of crypto regulation is unlikely to go away anytime soon. While SBF is involved in shaping U.S. legislation, the spotlight will remain firmly on him for the foreseeable future.

2022-10-31 09:59:48.592135,MakeUseOf,The 5 Best Crypto IRAs to Use for Your Retirement,"One eye on the future? Everyone should, really.

Cryptocurrencies are available to a wide range of investors, and there are now several ways to invest.

One such option is a Bitcoin IRA, which allows investors to buy and trade the asset using an established IRA platform ahead of their retirement. The following are the best crypto IRAs you can use to invest in Bitcoin against your retirement.

MakeUseOf Video of the Day

1. BitcoinIRA

BitcoinIRA is by far the most popular crypto IRA available. You can trade on the platform 24/7, making it possible to trade whenever you wish.

BitcoinIRA supports over 60 crypto assets, including Bitcoin, of course, and many top altcoins, such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and Cardano.

With just $3,000, you can open an IRA account and buy and start trading a single cryptocurrency or multiple cryptocurrencies of any combination.

You can also roll over other retirement funds such as traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, SEP IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs, 403b, or 401k into your BitcoinIRA account and keep trading.

BitcoinIRA works with crypto custodial services provider, BitGo to securely hold your crypto assets in offline cold storage, making it safe from attackers even if the platform is compromised.

What's more? A $700 million insurance policy covers your retirement investment should anything go wrong.

Apart from a one-time fee used to cover security, storage, and other costs, there are specific fees that BitcoinIRA doesn't state explicitly. You'll need to speak with an agent to get specific numbers, depending on how you want to structure your account.

2. BitIRA

BitIRA is one of the top crypto IRAs you should consider before retirement. Like BitcoinIRA, it supports several crypto assets for you to choose from, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.

You'll need a minimum of $5,000 to invest in this one, and you can invest in any number of the supported crypto assets. BitIRA's fees include $195 for annual maintenance, 0.05% of invested amount as a custody fee, and a one-time $50 setup fee, in addition to variable transaction fees.

For security, BitIRA employs cold storage with Equity Trust Company to securely provide custody for users' funds while giving them complete control of their assets. There's also a $100 million insurance cover for your funds in case of any misfortunes.

3. CoinIRA

CoinIRA provides a platform for investing in a single or multiple cryptocurrencies. It supports at least 20 assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Supported accounts include traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, SEP IRAs, and SIMPLE IRAs.

One thing that sets CoinIRA apart is that in addition to its crypto assets, it also provides a crypto IRA guide to help you better understand your investment. They also provide consultants to help answer any questions concerning your investment.

Also noteworthy is the fact that CoinIRA doesn't charge custody fees, even though Equity Trust Company is its crypto custodian, just like BitIRA. Instead, you'll need to pay a 1.25% buy transaction fee and a 1% sell transaction fee when trading.

There is no startup or maintenance fee, but the minimum initial investment is $5,000, which may be on the high side for some investors.

4. Regal Assets

Regal Assets is known for providing variety for its IRA account holders. Apart from cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin (and many others, with 22 in total), it also provides hard assets such as gold and silver.

Regal Assets started initially as a platform purely dedicated to precious metals. It only included cryptocurrencies in 2017, when the demand for cryptocurrencies started to soar.

Like the other IRA platforms, it uses offline storage to secure customers' assets, for which you'll pay $150 yearly for the storage and a $100 annual administrative fee.

You can sign up on Regal Assets and start with an initial investment or rollover your traditional IRA account into it. If your favorite crypto asset isn't among the listed 22, Regal Assets has an on-demand request for such a situation, and you can call to make a special request.

The major downside of this platform are the huge fees it charges for account maintenance and administration, but you can enjoy the variety that only a few platforms like it offer.

5. iTrustCapital

iTrustCapital is a reputable platform for crypto IRA investing and one that is more affordable than most. The platform is friendly towards both beginners and experienced investors alike, giving everyone a chance to experiment with a crypto IRA account.

If you're just starting out in crypto investing, it may be helpful to research which altcoins to invest in first.

With a minimum investment of just $1,000, iTrustCapital lowers the bar for crypto IRA investing for retirement to those with lower capital. Like Regal Assets, you can buy and trade crypto and hard assets, such as gold and silver, in real-time, using your retirement account on iTrustCapital.

There are over 25 cryptocurrencies to choose from, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins that you can trade at any time of the day, 24/7. There are no monthly or annual account maintenance fees, and the transaction fee for crypto is 1% flat. The transaction fee for gold is $50 per ounce, while silver is $2.50 per ounce.

Assets on iTrustCapital are covered with insurance of up to $370 million in collaboration with Coinbase Custody, the custodial services arm of Coinbase, one of America's best crypto exchanges.

The downside is that you can only fund your account with USD before buying crypto, as direct funding with crypto from another wallet is not allowed.

If you're looking for a low-cost platform to start your crypto IRA with just $1,000 and access digital and hard assets at an affordable cost, iTrustCapital may be the place for you.

Which BitcoinIRA Suits You?

These are the top crypto IRA platforms you can use to invest in crypto for your retirement. Depending on your needs, any of them may suit you, and you should choose based on what you wish to achieve.

For example, If you're looking for a combination of asset diversity and low fees, iTrustCapital is the choice. There are other factors that may come into play to decide which platform you choose ultimately, but be sure it is capable of helping you achieve your IRA crypto investment goals.","The following are the best crypto IRAs you can use to invest in Bitcoin against your retirement.

The analysis, dubbed the Blockchain Behavior Report, outlined major trends that affected the blockchain space in the last quarter, including regions where crypto adoption accelerated in both usage and regulatory efforts.

Countries That Led Crypto Adoption in Q3

The findings revealed that Ukraine, Indonesia, and Russia saw the biggest adoption growth, with their adoption rates increasing by 143.17%, 115.59%, and 88.28%, respectively.

The United States retained its position as the largest crypto market, with India overthrowing Russia from second place with an increase of 10.40%, while the latter ranked fourth. Indonesia moved from fifth to third place, with traffic surging by 115.59%.

Ukraine moved to fifth place with a 143.7% increase, while the United Kingdom dropped to sixth place with a 6.40% decline in September. Nigeria took seventh place after a 12.52% spike, while the Philippines decreased by 9.78% to the eighth position.

Despite maintaining its ninth position in the rank, Vietnam experienced the most substantial decrease, a 49.30% decline during the quarter. Germany and Brazil came next with a 3.38% decline and a 16.60% rise, respectively.

Gender, Age, and Regulation

The analysis further revealed that gender dominance in the blockchain space remained almost the same, as men still occupy about 75% of the industry. However, the female gender experienced a 6.16% growth between July and September.

Also, the Millenials and Gen Z comprised a major part of DappRadar’s visitors. While the former accounted for about 48.13%, the latter represented over 37% of the visitors, indicating a 7% growth from Q2.

Regulation in Q3 saw growth and focused development, with different bills passed and several proposals awaiting approval. Regulators in the U.S., U.K., and EU played an active role in this section, and from the look of things, new crypto rules are bound to emerge early next year.

Meanwhile, the Web3 space has been in an upward trend since the start of the year, and about 36% of all existing Web3 smart contracts were published this year.","Crypto adoption is shooting through the roof despite the bear market and uncertainty surrounding asset prices, according to recent findings from the leading decentralized application (dApp) analytics platform DappRadar.

2022-10-31 02:59:48.607752,Deccan Herald,India’s crypto firms long for breathing space,"India's crypto players are going through a rough patch.

Falling transaction volumes, regulatory vacuum, opposition from India’s central bank, money-laundering charges and a global crypto winter are threatening their very existence.

While crypto exchanges remain optimistic about the future with some believing that India is at the cusp of framing required policy, fund managers and industry experts are sceptical about the sector's growth in the near term.

“The Reserve Bank of India has concerns over cryptocurrencies as the regulator fears that money laundering will happen. Even their experience in the short term is not good. Unless the regulator takes a favourable view, funding to these entities will dry up,” Exfinity Ventures Chairman & former Infosys Chief Financial Officer V Balakrishnan said.

He said that many cryptocurrency-related businesses might have to migrate to foreign shores where regulations are conducive to their survival and growth.

Problems aplenty

A global crypto winter has hurt transaction volumes significantly.

The average daily trading volume of global crypto funds fell 34per cent to $61.3 million in October, touching the lowest level since June 2020, according to digital asset data provider CryptoCompare. Products based on major digital currencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum have witnessed a steep downtrend during this period.

Indian crypto exchanges have not escaped this trend, with their trade volumes dropping drastically in the last six months, according to data aggregator nomics.com. Some reports suggested an up to 90per cent fall as investors left in droves.

Steep correction in crypto coin prices is one of the major reasons for such an outcome. For instance, the price of Bitcoin - the most popular cryptocurrency - has fallen by almost 60per cent to $19,210.80 apiece from $47,733.40 a year ago. The fall in other major currencies is way deeper.

“Volumes are a direct result of sentiment; not just crypto but all major global indices are down. Volumes will recover when sentiment improves. We are investing in investor education as we believe that this is the best time to learn about crypto which will pay dividends when the bull market comes,” Rajagopal Menon, the vice president of crypto exchange WazirX told DH.

Indian taxation rules have made things worse.

Though the world’s second-most populous country is yet to formulate a policy framework to regulate digital assets, this year’s budget introduced a levy of a 30per cent tax on income from crypto transactions. It also implemented a TDS (tax deducted at source) of 1per cent on the sale of cryptocurrency assets from July 1, wiping off most inflows into these digital assets.

Fears of money laundering

The Enforcement Directorate’s probe into alleged money laundering involving gaming apps and Chinese loan operators through crypto exchanges has dented the credibility of the ecosystem. In recent months, all major crypto exchanges have come under the radar with a search by the ED on their premises. WazirX, CoinDCX, CoinSwitch Kuber and others have been brought under the purview of the ongoing investigation.

Around nine exchanges, several fintech firms and a few payment platforms are currently under ED’s radar for alleged violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), sources told DH on condition of anonymity.

“ED investigation is about Chinese loan apps and the nine crypto exchanges were called on as witnesses to provide information about transactions. The ED is not investigating crypto exchanges. The investigation is ongoing, the industry will cooperate completely and the law will take its course,” said WazirX’s Menon.

Ray of hope

While the crypto industry is plagued with problems, some see a glimmer of hope that things will improve as India takes up the G20 Presidency in December.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said that crypto will be part of India’s agenda in the upcoming G20 meet. It is in pursuit of creating standard operating procedures (SOPs) for cryptocurrencies through global consensus in its bid to address the concerns over the end use.

“We are seeing the first signs of this happening with the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) developing the Crypto Asset Reporting Framework,” Menon said. “The Common Reporting Standard required jurisdictions to obtain information from financial institutions and exchange such information with other jurisdictions.”

“Critically, India is to take up G20 Presidency from December 1, 2022, to November 30, 2023, and the FM plans to discuss cryptos during its presidency and intends to establish a technology-driven regulatory framework,” he told DH.

While the crypto ecosystem remains optimistic about future growth, its denizens have already started facing the heat. Layoffs have become widespread in recent months and HR experts highlighted how good talent was shying away from joining the industry.

As the RBI is all set to launch a pilot for Digital Rupee in the coming months, the ecosystem will evolve further.

“It’s just a matter of time before the ecosystem stabilises with a favourable regulatory environment. Till that time, it’s a matter of survival,” said an entrepreneur who is eyeing the launch of a Web 3-related startup in the coming days.","Falling transaction volumes, regulatory vacuum, opposition from India’s central bank, money-laundering charges and a global crypto winter are threatening their very existence.

2022-10-31 03:59:48.620044,BeInCrypto,Halloween Crypto Represent: Last Minute Costume Ideas: we Got You,"Halloween has turned up fast. Haven’t got an outfit? Are you a crypto lover? Then relax, here are some ideas you can fumble together in a few minutes.

Halloween started in Ireland and was originally known as Samhain. Samhain was the start of the dark half of the year. The Irish have two halves of the year – one light and one dark.

It was on this night – on the cusp of the light half and the dark half – that the veil between this world and the other world (their afterlife) became thin. Ghosts and ghouls could come through to the living and annoy them and upset them.

To keep these bad spirits at bay, the Irish started wearing scary costumes on this night to scare away the ghouls. But, there was an upside. Because the veil between the living and the dead was thin, you could also feel and sense your relatives in the room with you. On Samhain night, still to this day in Ireland, people set a place at the table for dead relatives. They also might fill the dog bowl of a passed-over pet.

Another interesting thing about Samhain is that it falls on the night that magic mushrooms come into season. You can imagine the visions on the night and why the festival became a thing! In fact, in Irish Gaelic, the word for magic mushrooms is the name word as ghosts – púca – or the Anglicized version, pooka.

Samhain to Halloween

When the church came along to Ireland, it wanted to control the minds of the Irish. It took many of their festivals and made them their own by transposing church traditions over them. The winter solstice became Christmas and so on. But the church didn’t win them all. Samhain wasn’t entirely conquered. It might have been those magic mushies.

The church put Hallow’s Day on top of Samhain. The church asked people to remember the dead, including saints, and martyrs. Hallow’s Eve eventually became Halloween. But Hallow’s eve, the night before this, really wasn’t conquered in Ireland. It is still called Samhain today. And there are still a lot of magic mushies after the rain.

Americans made Halloween into something different from the original. But now, it’s bigger and better, and typically ostentatious in the American style. And so too, they have done that with crypto costumes on Halloween. Here are some ideas for you to take to the party!

This suave guy dressed up as the blockchain. And of course, he posted the outfit to Reddit. Which then, naturally turned into an epic thread.

Comments underneath the pic were of every level.

“Damn dude save some pussy for the rest of us.”

“He’s got all the pussy waiting in his Lambo.”

“Bad thing is he cock-blocked himself.”

“Looks like 51% attack.”

“You should be holding forks in your hands.”

“It doubles as a chastity belt.”

“You aren’t decentralized though.”

“Is that a roll of bitcoins in your pocket or are you just happy to see us?”

“I’d throw stuff at people and call it airdrop.”

“Just do some drive-by farting…and yell “AIRDROP!”

“Dude has cryptographically secured his on-going loneliness, and that’s something we don’t have to trust, we can verify.”

“Best superhero ever.”

“But where is the whitepaper?”

This blockchain overlord said, “Someone brought glowsticks and people kept giving them to me so by the end of the night it looked like this.”

Obviously, he upgraded to the Lightening Network.

Any crypto sis seeing this at a party would be immediately in love.

He said, “Most people didn’t get it right away but generally people didn’t have to ask. The whole night I had groups of people with puzzled looks staring at me then one of them would have a lightbulb moment and come over and yell, ‘Are you the blockchain?’ Especially later on with the lights people really liked it, I was pleasantly surprised at the reactions. I had homemade “Bitcoins” in one of the boxes. I gave them out to people. They were just orange pieces of cardboard with the B on them!”

Halloween Crypto Daytrader

This costume is for the crypto bro or sis in the crypto winter.

All you have to do is find a uniform of any type, and say you have a real job now.

Many a joke has come from crypto skeptics about enthusiasts getting a real job. Well, if you are a crypto trader and you are feeling like you need to thaw from crypto winter, there’s potential in the fast-food industry for you. Good luck!

Bitcoin Barbie

This Bitcoin Barbie needs to become an actual Barbie. Who doesn’t want their little girl to be playing with a hot pink day trader doll? All you need for this outfit is a box and a lot of pink stuff. Go forth crypto sis, and do your thing.

Bitcoin Miners

Another great idea is to get a gang and go as Bitcoin miners. You must have one of your victims dress as a Bitcoin, however.

All you need is some lumberjack shirts, a headlamp and strong shoulders. Go forth.

Halloween Doge

This outfit is the best for a very last-minute outfit. As long as you have a printer at home, you can go as Dogecoin. Loved by meme fans, and protected by the overlord of the world, Elon Musk, this is the perfect outfit for any slacker who is forced to socialize at a crypto Halloween party.

Dress as a fashion NFT

Some IRL outfits look like the crazy outfits that you can buy as NFTs for your avatar. NFT fashion can be as totally bananas as it wants to be, because it is digital. For a costume, interpret that as a real-life outfit. You could make a dress out of aluminum foil just like this lovely lady. She looks ready to be covered in garlic and oil and popped into the oven at 180 degrees.

This is an excellent idea for a last-minute outfit… find your craziest, most embarrassing outfit you bought while you were drunk that one time, and say you are a fashion NFT. You could even mint an NFT of you wearing the outfit, for extra authenticity. Then of course, try to sell that NFT nugget to anyone who will listen to you at the party.

There you go, last minute crypto costumes. Please do tag us on Twitter with your crypto costumes!

The MOU, signed by the Thai Fintech Association (TFA) and the Hungarian Blockchain Coalition on Oct. 25, will see the two associations “share experiences, best practices and explore areas potentially beneficial for direct cooperation,” according to a Facebook post by the Embassy of Hungary in Bangkok.

TFA president Chonladet Khemarattana said that e-commerce, mobile payments, and digital currencies are growing rapidly in Thailand and that international cooperation is needed to further develop local financial technology, according to an Oct. 29 report from the Bangkok Post.

He also claimed 20% of the world’s crypto holders are in Thailand, the country placed eighth on the 2022 Global Crypto Adoption Index released in September by analytics firm Chainalysis and crypto payments company TripleA estimates almost 6.5% of the population owns cryptocurrency,

The Hungarian Blockchain Coalition was jointly created by the country’s Ministry of Innovation and Technology and the National Data and Economy Knowledge Centre in March 2022, while the Thai Fintech Association is a nonprofit founded in 2016 with the aim of representing the local financial technology industry including cryptocurrency exchanges.

The pact comes as Thailand’s central bank, along with some of the country’s commercial banks, were involved in the testing of a cross-border wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) transaction platform using distributed ledger technology in September.

The Bank of Thailand also announced in August it was looking to start a pilot of a retail CBDC by the end of 2022 at a limited scale in the private sector among roughly 10,000 users. It would test the digital currency using “cash-like activities” such as paying for goods or services.

Meanwhile, Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has enacted some restrictions on crypto this year, with it banning the use of cryptocurrencies for payments in March, saying they “could affect the stability of the financial system.”

The regulator is also cracking down on crypto lending platforms, with the SEC planning to prohibit crypto exchanges from providing or supporting digital asset depository services.

Hungary seemingly takes a similar hard stance on cryptocurrencies. In February, the governor of the Hungarian National Bank, György Matolcsy, wanted a blanket ban on all crypto trading and mining across the European Union, saying it “serviced illegal activities” and was “speculative.”","The financial technology associations for Thailand and Hungary have signed a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to support the introduction of blockchain technology to their respective financial sectors.

2022-10-31 07:59:48.967447,The Indian Express,How Elon Musk could put more crypto into Twitter,"After months of dramatic back-and-forth, Elon Musk has taken control of Twitter Inc., igniting emotions ranging from hope to anxiety among users who are bracing themselves for how the billionaire will put his stamp on the social-media platform. Crypto Twitter is no exception.

Digital-asset enthusiasts have long congregated on Twitter, where they’ve changed their profile pictures to images of themselves with “laser eyes” as a signal of their crypto support, posted irreverent memes about rising (and then falling) coin prices and re-tweeted threads from their favorite founders.

Musk, a prolific tweeter himself, has had a complicated relationship with crypto, seeming to embrace it one minute and belittle it the next. That hasn’t stopped industry supporters from imagining an expansion of Twitter’s blockchain features under his management that would broaden mainstream adoption. Their elation has likely helped boost interest in Dogecoin, Musk’s token of choice, which has soared days leading up to his finally sealing the deal.

If you’re still not trying to master crypto & meme coins after @elonmusk buying Twitter then you are about to be very disappointed you didn’t. 💎🤷🏻‍♂️ — Joey Hickson (@joeyhickson) October 28, 2022

Twitter has made its own forays into crypto. Co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey is one of the industry’s most well-known Bitcoin bulls, and under his leadership, the company introduced a feature to let users receive tips in Bitcoin, built a Twitter Crypto division and started Bluesky, a project dedicated to building a decentralized social media network that is now an independent company. Since Dorsey’s departure last November, Twitter has added Ether tipping, nonfungible token profile pictures and USD Coin stablecoin payments for a select group of creators.

ALSO READ | Elon Musk is said to have ordered job cuts across Twitter

It’s unclear what will happen to these efforts under the leadership of Musk, who’s been notoriously mercurial about crypto and may clean out the platform’s digital-asset team as other high-profile executives exit. While the Tesla Inc. CEO has touted Dogecoin on Twitter enough to earn the moniker “the Dogefather,” he called the token “a hustle” when he hosted “Saturday Night Live” in May 2021. He also added the ability to pay in Bitcoin for Tesla’s electric vehicles in 2021, but ended the practice less than two months later, citing the cryptocurrency’s environmental impact.

In putting together the Twitter acquisition, Musk has seemed to waver on his commitment to crypto. Binance Holdings Ltd., the world’s largest digital-asset exchange, committed $500 million to Musk’s financing for the deal in May and is reportedly building a team focused on exploring how crypto could be useful to the social media company. In a trove of text messages released as part of litigation over the Twitter deal, Musk initially discussed using blockchain to promote free speech and reduce spam on social media, only to write later that “blockchain Twitter isn’t possible.”

But if Musk did decide to have crypto play a bigger role on Twitter, here are some ways he could do it:

Bots and spam on Twitter are huge pain points for Musk, and helped spark a contentious legal battle that put his acquisition of the company in jeopardy. The issue is particularly important in crypto, where spam accounts impersonate famous figures like Musk in order to promote scams involving fake crypto giveaways. But some digital-asset enthusiasts believe that using blockchain could help reduce bots on Twitter. A blockchain-based identity verification tool or an NFT passport could be options for promoting Musk’s goal of wanting to “authenticate all real humans”on Twitter.

Freedom of speech is close to Musk’s heart, and he intends to lift the company’s lifelong bans on users. Those values align with those of many crypto believers dedicated to the ethos of decentralization promoted by blockchain. They think that a single entity shouldn’t make major decisions over how a platform is managed.

While Musk could potentially implement a token-based voting system that allows users to have more say over what happens on Twitter, it’s important to note that his potential embrace of crypto is a doubled-edged sword. While adding more crypto elements on Twitter could expand mainstream usage of digital assets, it will further consolidate Musk’s influence over an industry that many want to be as decentralized as possible.

Musk has already expressed ambitions of turning Twitter into a “super app” and spoken admirably of China’s WeChat platform, which can handle messaging, games, payments and video streaming. With other aspiring super app creators like Revolut Ltd. expanding into crypto, it would make sense if Musk’s vision included digital assets as well. Allowing more cryptocurrencies for tipping could be a first step, with Dogecoin being a likely top candidate given Musk’s love of the token.

Other mainstream social media platforms like Instagram are diving further into NFTs. Though Musk has mocked these assets in the past, including Twitter’s decision to allow authenticated NFT profile pictures, he could introduce more NFT features, such as a marketplace or the ability for users to create a profile represented by an NFT that gives them greater ownership over their content — a practice already implemented by decentralized social media platform Lens Protocol.

These measures could ensure that Twitter doesn’t fall behind other social media giants in terms of crypto adoption.

While integrating these blockchain elements would be a complex and closely watched undertaking for Twitter, Musk’s new reign still opens up the potential for them to become a reality.","Crypto Twitter is no exception.

Traditionally decoupled from wider market movements, we are now seeing closer correlation between the crypto market and the macroeconomy, with many cryptocurrencies behaving like other risk assets such as stocks.

The role of crypto in the macroeconomy

With no indications that global macro pressures will ease off, along with an expected correction of at least 10-20% in stock prices, we perhaps shouldn’t expect to see a significant recovery in crypto prices by the year-end. On the flip-side, we have seen central banks tightening monetary policy more rapidly than we have seen in recent years, so it will be interesting to see what effect this may (or may not) have on crypto prices.

The influence of wider market conditions on crypto were perhaps best observed in The Merge. Despite the best efforts to drive prices up through the promise of less energy consumption, lower operational costs and the “airdrop” of the ETHPOW token, this event had much more success technically rather than driving positive price momentum. While it could be argued that some initial selling pressure in the price of ETH was fuelled by PoW miners selling off inventory, the finger still points firmly at the uncertainty of the macro economy. As long as interest rates and inflation continue to rise, risk assets such as cryptocurrencies will have a difficulty decoupling from the market in a sustainable way.

Decoupling crypto and the macroeconomy

Recent volatility in crypto markets was fuelled by large institutions going insolvent, many protocols being hacked and catastrophic events such as the Terra-Luna collapse. As a result, many investors have become much more cautious and aware of the risks in crypto. While we can expect this sentiment to continue for some time, once there is more clarity on regulation, as well as further development of use cases and utility for different crypto assets we should expect to see a substantial increase in crypto being included as part of investment portfolios for both retail and institutional investors.

When crypto as an industry matures further, and the number of active users inside the crypto economy continues to rise, we do expect there to be an opportunity for crypto to decouple from the wider risk asset market. Of course, this still relies on the macro environment improving significantly; as long as there is uncertainty over the future of the wider economy, it will be difficult for sentiment around crypto, and other risk assets, to improve too.

The crypto lending market

The high-profile collapses of Voyager, Three Arrows, and Celsius in 2022 certainly sent shockwaves through the crypto community, however they may be the catalysts needed to better align the crypto markets with traditional finance (TradFi).

Regulation will most certainly tighten up, pushing crypto market operators closer to TradFi operators. We should start to see more comprehensive in-house risk management functions from crypto providers, and investors are now much more likely to demand transparency over where, and how, their allocations are being stored and used. We believe that all successful players in the market will have these considerations at the core of their business going forward.

That being said, unsecured lending will most definitely still continue to be a part of the crypto industry in the future, just as it is in TradiFi today; without this accelerated activity we would see a slow-down in innovation. What will change, however, is a ramp up of risk management and the appropriate pricing of risk in unsecured lending. We already see this in the market today, with many crypto providers hiring risk management teams from the TradFi industry to be more compliant.

While it’s tempting to view secure lending as the watertight option in ensuring confidence and security in the market, this still relies on a better level of transparency from crypto operators and improved regulation in the industry. You only need to look at recent exploits in DeFi to see that secured lending can’t rely on the value of crypto alone; collateral may be manipulated if the token is illiquid, and events like a complete market crash can erase any value entirely. It would be positive to see a move towards the standardisation of loan agreements that we see in TradFi; the inclusion of loan covenants would be just one move that would create products that can easily be compared to each other. Again, operators can also help boost confidence in the industry by publishing financials and giving guidance on future business expectations.

The lending and earning of interest on excess assets, and the borrowing of scarce assets, are key pillars of any functioning market; they optimise the economy by ensuring assets are directed to where they are most useful. Borrowing provides a cost-effective way for the market operators engaging in different activities in the market to do those activities, while lending provides a way for other market operators to make use of their excess assets and earn an interest on them rather than letting them sit at their wallet doing nothing.

In the current crypto market, we are seeing the market makers and market-neutral hedge funds generate the best returns in the lending ecosystem, and so most lending activities are centred around these players. Market operators with excess capital are also earning the best risk-adjusted returns from directing their capital into crypto. In the future, it may be Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) looking to invest into building crypto infrastructure, or a new product used by billions of people or investment managers, that will generate best risk-adjusted returns, at which point most of the money will be directed here.

The outlook for 2023

A potential recovery of the crypto market depends on a number of macro driven metrics that are still very much uncertain. However, we see that most of these are already priced in, and many of our used indicators suggest the market bottom could be near. For example, the Bitcoin supply in profit as of 13 Oct 2022 is on the same levels as it was during the Covid crash and the 2018-2019 bear market bottom. We expect a recovery of some sort during the next year, but it remains to be seen how strong the drivers are to sustain any positive momentum. This again depends a lot on the macro environment as prices of risk assets are not able to sustain a long rally if rate hikes continue or we move into a recession.

The crypto industry has a history of hostility towards regulation but, when done right in a collaborative manner, regulation helps to create a more secure and more reliable market with better standardised practices. This also advances market efficiency, which is needed if the industry truly wishes to challenge the banks, asset managers and other industry players of the TradFi world.

The crypto industry as a whole is currently at a tipping point: what we as an industry decide to do next is what determines the success or failure of our industry and crypto as a whole. Only by welcoming regulation, offering transparency to customers, regulators and other stakeholders, and ensuring appropriate risk management, can the crypto industry look to change current sentiment and better align itself with the demands of traditional finance.

These financial dealings for suspected drug deals in Nigeria, the Cayman Islands, and the British Virgin Islands were reportedly carried out through three Indian digital asset management companies, a report in the Economic Times said.

Illegal Drug Transactions

Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Income Tax Department, among other agencies, are probing the case.

“Digital currency was used to buy and sell drugs and some of these companies facilitated it…So far the agency has been able to track transactions worth Rs 28,000 crore [$3.5 billion],” the Economic Times quoted an unnamed senior government official.

A majority of these transactions were carried out through these three crypto firms, and they were not reported to the authorities, investigators believe.

As per the media coverage, these transactions that took place between 2019 and 2022 came to light after several drug traffickers were arrested by the Hyderabad Narcotics Enforcement Wing. They used to operate on the Dark Web and use crypto for payments.

The FIU is a national agency that receives all reports of suspicious financial transactions from Indian probe agencies and cooperates extensively with law enforcement agencies internationally in investigating terror and drug financing.

Gaze on Dark Net and Crypto

India’s Home Minister Amit Shah last week said at a high-level meeting on drug trafficking and national security that cases of drug smuggling through the dark net and cryptocurrencies have increased in recent years.

For the last several months, Indian investigating agencies are proactively chasing frauds and wrongdoings in the local crypto space. Early this month, the ED raided several premises linked to the accused of a gaming app scam and recovered cash and bitcoins, which were frozen.

In August, the ED searched the office and residences of CoinSwitch Kuber’s top executives, including the directors and CEO, for suspected violation of foreign exchange rules. Earlier, it was reported that ED was investigating 10 private companies for money laundering of $125 million.","Indian investigation agencies are probing three crypto exchanges for their roles in illegal drug trade transactions after they were alerted by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which has zeroed in on nearly 200 such transactions.

2022-10-31 09:59:49.007245,The Hindu BusinessLine,Finding fewer but qualitative crypto projects to invest in India: Cypher Capital,"Crypto investment firm Cypher Capital, amidst a downturn in the crypto market, is finding fewer but qualitative Web 3 and blockchain startups to invest in India. Its Managing Partner and CEO Vineet Budki said the firm is looking to invest in projects that focus on building blockchain infrastructure that will be scalable as crypto adoption increases.

“We are looking at three to five startups in a month. When BTC was at $70,000, everybody was building a Web3 startup, but now in a bear market, we are finding fewer but qualitative projects. Additionally, with Indian founders shifting their base to Dubai and Singapore we are facing a problem with categorising them,” Budki told businessline.

Speaking about the effect of crypto regulatory changes in India, Budki said Indian Web 3 startups are still not clear about the government’s rules and regulations. This, he opines, is resulting in Indian founders shifting focus on figuring out regulatory moves, then building a product and getting adoption.“ Although the government is trying to understand the ecosystem, it has to fasten its pace in order to avoid brain and value drain,” he added.

Scalable infra

Cypher Capital is interested to invest in scalable blockchain infrastructure projects that will facilitate the widespread adoption of crypto. “We believe that in 10 years, around 10-15 percent of the population will adopt crypto, building infrastructure that can support forming of wallets, Defi, etc. becomes important. Going forward, exchanges, wallets, chain, and layer solutions, play to earn model startups will be the key focus areas for investment,” Budki said.

Currently the VC firm has three projects built out of India in consideration. “Investments of $4 - $5 million should emerge in the next two to three months. About 15-20 per cent of the fund will be invested,” Budki said. The UAE-based fund had earlier committed 40 per cent of its $100-million fund to Indian Web 3 and blockchain startups. So far, the firm has invested over $15 million in crypto startups globally.","Crypto investment firm Cypher Capital, amidst a downturn in the crypto market, is finding fewer but qualitative Web 3 and blockchain startups to invest in India.

The IJMs at EY Corporate Advisors filed the report, asking the Singapore High Court to compel Hodlnaut founders Zhu Juntao and Simon Lee to present the hidden documents, TechinAsia reported.

According to the report: “The IJMs have encountered significant difficulties in piecing together an accurate and complete picture of the company’s financial position. Among other reasons, the company’s accounting and financial records have not been properly maintained prior to the IJMs appointment.”

Hodlnaut Founders Reportedly Uncooperative

The IJM accused the Hodlnaut founders Zhu Juntao and Simon Lee and some unnamed employees of being uncooperative. Reportedly, they are obstructing judicial managers from accessing and controlling several vital documents and records.

These include over 1,000 files deleted from the Google Workspace since the IJMs were appointed.

The documents would have helped the IJMs to understand the financial position of crypto lender Hodlnaut better. There’s also a problem of improper maintenance of accounting and financial records even before the IJM appointments.

Dear users, a new update from the Company’s Interim Judicial Managers was issued on 28 October 2022. The update can be found here: https://t.co/OhPXpS4bfY — Hodlnaut (@hodlnautdotcom) October 28, 2022

So far, the court-appointed managers are yet to get accurate information on the crypto lender DeFi positions. The DeFi assets account for most of the Hodlnaut crypto assets and are on several platforms. These include Compound, Aave, Curve, and Convex.

The lender assets on centralized exchanges only account for $25.7 million of the estimated $104 million it has. This is far lower than the total liabilities, which stand at $377 million.

Simon Lee Accuses Judicial Managers of Dishonesty

The report comes a week after Hodlnaut co-founder Simon Lee filed an affidavit against the IJM accusing them of dishonesty. According to Lee, the IJMs had sacked the embattled firm’s former lawyer despite assurances that they would be retained.

Simon Lee said that there is a possible case of conflict of interest in the new hire. WongPartnership could be swayed by one of its largest creditors the Algorand Foundation. WongPartnership has reportedly acknowledged that it represents Algorand Foundation.

With the IJMs not having access to complete information, they can’t decide whether the Hodlnaut can continue or be liquidated. However, liquidation is looking more likely given that only three employees remain out of 38 that were there before August.

The report also hinted at the possibility of criminal charges against the founder. Mainly as it emerged that the directors told some employees to withdraw their funds before announcing they were halting withdrawals.

Hodlnaut is one of the corporate victims of the Terra LUNA UST crash. After disclosing its losses in August, the Monetary Authority of Singapore withdrew the in-principle license that allows the Hodlnaut to offer crypto-lending service.","A Singapore court report has disclosed that bankrupt crypto lender Hodlnaut has been hiding some documents from the court-appointed Interim Judicial Managers (IJMs).
