2022-10-31 11:43:35.471467,AMBCrypto,Solana investors on cloud 9 have these SOL ecosystem developments to thank,"Solana [SOL] has been in the limelight for its NFT space since quite a while now. Solana Daily, A Solana-centric Twitter handle, recently posted a tweet around the same. The tweet also mentioned all the major developments that happened in its NFT ecosystem over the last week.

Solana NFTs Highlight Week 43@metaplex is building a new asset class@arcade2earn raised $3.2M in a seed funding round Solana collection trades FREE on @SolanartNFT (1/3) pic.twitter.com/ARrs3CDrjS — Solana Daily (@solana_daily) October 29, 2022

_____________________________________________________________________________________

Here’s AMBCrypto’s Price Prediction for Solana [SOL] for 2023-2024

_____________________________________________________________________________________

A few notable developments included that Bonfida integrated with Notifinetwork. This new integration brought along several new features, such as new and improved alerts, which have become easier to set up. Moreover, another important update was that Solana collection trade became free on SalanartNFT.

Interestingly, Solana’s Q3 looked extremely promising for Solana’s NFT ecosystem as it witnessed considerable growth. Between July and September, the overall number of daily new NFTs on the network increased by 19.3%, which was commendable.

However, despite these events, Santiment’s data revealed a different story. According to the chart, Solana’s total NFT trade count went down over the last week. This was contrary to the aforementioned developments. Incidentally, Solana’s NFT trade volume in USD registered a spike on 26 October, but later witnessed a downfall.

Solana geared up

While SOL’s NFT space grew over the last three months, SOL’s price action also showed promising movements in the last seven days. This was exciting news for investors. CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that SOL registered over 15% weekly gains and at press time was trading at $32.90 with a market capitalization of over $11.8 billion.

Solana’s on-chain metrics also painted a bullish picture for the token, further giving hope to investors. For instance, SOL received significant interest from the derivatives market as its Binance funding rate went up last week. Not only this, but Solana’s development activity also surged considerably, which was a positive sign for the blockchain.

Furthermore, the popularity of Solana in the crypto community was highlighted as its social volume spiked over the last week.

SOL traders can sit back and relax

Several Solana market indicators were backing the possibility of a further price surge. Some credit for this development should also go to the current bullish market, because of which most of the cryptos were pumping. The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Ribbon revealed that the bulls might soon have an upper hand in the market.

This was because the 20-day EMA was fast approaching the 55-day EMA. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) registered a golden crossover and indicated a buyers’ advantage. The Bollinger Bands (BB) suggested that SOL’s price was about to enter a high volatility zone. This increased the chances of a continued northward movement. However, the Money Flow Index (MFI) went down slightly and was directed towards the neutral mark. This could restrict a further price surge in the coming days.","Solana [SOL] has been in the limelight for its NFT space since quite a while now.

2022-10-30 12:43:35.483133,NewsBTC,Ethereum Scores Over 22% Gains While Solana Recorded 15%,"After facing a market-wide correction, several coins, including Ethereum and Solana, have recorded substantial gains in the past week. Earlier today, Ethereum reached a 24-hour high of $1,652 before dropping to $1,602 at press time. The Ethereum killer Solana also peaked at $33.74 on the day. However, it has fallen to $32.66.

Although both have suffered some losses on the day, the coins have kept impressive profits in the last seven days. The top-ten tokens by market cap recorded a weekly gain of over 10%. Ethereum and Solana are poised to finish the month of October strong if they continue at this pace.

Ethereum Breaks Through $1.6k. What To Expect Next

After months of decline, the price of Ethereum appears to be following the market’s lead. It found key support near the $1250 level, pushing its price above the descending channel pattern. The price is testing and likely breaking above the major negative trendline.

According to traditional price action, the market should be able to break over the $2,000 resistance level relatively easily. Anyway, the 200-day moving average is hovering around the $1700 mark, which might be a significant barrier for Ethereum. After months of slumping, Ethereum’s structure would turn bullish if the price breaks above the moving average and the $2000 zone. As a result, ETH’s price can go up in the mid-term.

The 4-hour chart is similarly bullish, with the market impulsively breaking over the $1400 level and heading into the $1800 barrier area. However, a bearish divergence is visible in the current RSI indicator. There appear to be limited static resistance points before the $1800 level. Therefore, a correction or reversal may be on the horizon in response to this signal. The $1400 level might act as a critical support level and propel the price higher if a major correction occurs.

How Solana Is Fairing: Looking At The Charts

Solana currently trades at $32.66, with a 24-hour volume of $1,166,152,851. The price of Solana has fallen by less than 1% in the last day. Over the past day, trading volumes have reduced marginally. Plus, the altcoin’s Volume to Market Cap Ratio is still quite low.

SOL Coin’s price peaked at $260.06 on November 6, 2021, and it has struggled to recover to that level ever since. At present, the Solana price is rising, and the coin is trading above the 20, 50 simple moving averages with a bullish bias. This suggests that it may retest the $35 barrier level. Moreover, a golden cross is imminent as the 20 SMA on the four-hour chart has recently crossed above the 200 SMA. But the support is currently at $30.

Several indicators suggest bullish momentum for Solana. Firstly, the signal line is above the MACD line, approaching a positive zone. An additional piece of evidence supporting the bullish case is the growing histograms. The relative strength index (RSI) is currently at 57.91. This is favorable for the bulls but is quickly approaching overbought levels. As a whole, the market is bullish based on these readings.

2022-10-31 10:43:35.485217,The Coin Republic,Glance At Solana’s Performance In Q3 This Year,"Increase in network activity at SOL (Solana).

The expansion in the blockchain network’s NFT sector.

DeFi in Solana continues to thrive.

According to CoinGecko, there is a massive 16.4% increase and at the time of writing SOL is $32.84. Despite a bear market from the month of May, it has shown fair results in its journey.

Crypto research tool Messari tells about the true position of the Solana network which represents L1’s inside operations. In spite of the gloomy crypto market, the data shows that Solana has performed appreciably in the third quarter.

SOL Soaring Network Activity

As depicted by Research analyst James Trautman at Messari, network activity has grown at Solana. It is seen that quarter on quarter(QoQ) network activity has soared by close to 70% from 20.544 million in the second quarter(Q2).

Solana is an open-source public blockchain network which without sacrificing its decentralization and security provides scalability and promotes smart contracts. It works on Proof-of-History (PoH) mechanism.

Also,the number of transactions processed per second (TPS) has increased by 40% from 2,310 TPS in Q2 to 3,200 in Q3. Main cause of this is an improved network due to which transaction activity is balanced and increased.

As per the reports, transaction fees have been consistently falling since late 2021. The 40% decline in transaction fees is seen drowning from $0.0005 to $0.0003, which made Solana more favorable to devs who prefer to build dApps on Layer 1 blockchain with an efficient performance.

Lowered network performance as experienced in 2021 and also in Q1 and Q2 of the ongoing year has decreased network transaction activity and its revenue simultaneously.As a result of reduction in the network’s transaction fees, its revenue tends to fall approximately by 25%. But Solana may bounce back in the upcoming quarters(Q4).

Next Move For Stability

On 23 June, Solana Labs’s CEO, Anatoly Yakovenko, announced the launch of a software development kit for Web3 programs called “Solana Mobile Stack (SMS)” in the first quarter of next year. SOL is among the first major crypto companies that is introducing its crypto phone: The “Saga”. This will also attract new users.

On 27 October, Solana retweeted on Messari – “Solana has continued implementing solutions to expand its ecosystem and improve network reliability. Into Q4 and beyond, the team will continue to implement strategies to expand its ecosystem”.

The total number of daily new NFTs soared to over 8 million in the SOL network, constituting about overall 19.3% of growth each quarter. But on the other side, it has seen a reduction in both NFT buyers and sellers. Whereas DeFi in Solana continues to grow but also decelerated and stabilized.","Increase in network activity at SOL (Solana).

2022-10-31 09:43:35.498487,Bitcoinist,Is Rocketize Meme Token As Smart As Solana and Cardano Currency?,"One of the interesting and eye-catching sets of cryptocurrencies is meme coins. In our increasingly connected society, memes reflect the most recent stage in the evolution of language. The fundamentals of communication have been reinvented in the 21st century to include a blend of comedic, visual, and textual genres. By the adoption of these non-traditional incentive structures, both Decentralised Finance (DeFi) and Decentralised Autonomous Organizations, can reinvent how communities function.

All thanks to Dogecoin for inventing the wheel. Dogecoin was launched in 2013 as a joke against Bitcoin. DOGE’s inspiration came from the Japanese Shiba Inu dog which shows charming features. However, Rocketize is another meme that seeks to become how the public can learn about the benefits of the decentralized network provided by Binance Smart Chain. The developers of Rocketize compare the benefits of Rocketize for BSC and DeFi to Neil Armstrong’s work for humanity. With its undying approach, Rocketize envisioned itself becoming a keyword in crypto space.

Can Rocketize Token Buy The Heart of The Cryptocurrency Fans?

Rocketize is a BEP-20 token that runs on the Binance Smart Chain. Knowing the worth of a community, Rocketize Token carefully makes use of its community’s potential as a multifaceted and ever-expanding talent pool. It accomplishes this, by utilizing Decentralized tools and governance, which allow community members to exercise power over their budgets and choices.

Rocketize Token is involved in creating memes like images, cartoons, movies, audio, and other forms of artistic and educational content. The platform promises to be fun, rewarding, and entertaining to get members ever thrilled with creativities.

The Rocketize Token community, nicknamed “Atomic Nation” is focused on the growth of the economy. This is set to be achieved through the use of its native currency, JATO, along with a collaborative effort of the community members. While it is believed that no one, according to the “chicken before egg” paradox can develop without resources, or grow without a means, Rocketize is out to dispute the fact.

Rocketize has a lot of outstanding rewards for its buyers. JATO might be a good fit especially if bought during its pre-sale.

Is Solana Blockchain Better Thank Ethereum

Solana is one of the top coins in the cryptocurrency space. It is rated among the top 9 with a market cap size of about 11 billion. Solana, as a decentralized platform, is powered by SOL, its native currency.

The Solana blockchain possesses unique features which give an advantage over the Ethereum blockchain. Some of it is its ability to fast transaction speed as well as a low transaction cost. The SOL platform is built to encourage the creation of Decentralized Applications (DApp). The Solana network combines the Proof-of-history with the Proof-of-stake mechanism to produce a scalable platform. Solana might be a good choice if you are considering a long-term investment.

Is Cardano Algorithm More Effective Than The Proof-of-work Mechanism?

Cardano, just like other cryptocurrencies, is a decentralized coin that operates on the Proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. Cardano is designed as a platform for smart contracts, to support the creation of enterprise-level DApps while it offers more sophisticated functionality than any other protocol ever created.

The Cardano platform also aspires to adopt a decentralized governance structure that will let the project develop over time and fund itself sustainably through an innovative treasury mechanism.

Cardano’s “research first” approach to design is one of the most distinctive aspects of the Cardano Project. Cardano can be bought on different available Decentralized Exchanges (DEX).

2022-10-31 09:43:35.500298,CryptoMode,Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) Investors Shift To Flasko (FLSK) – CryptoMode,"As the end of 2022 approaches, many crypto investors evaluate what cryptocurrencies have huge growth potential for 2023. Many Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) investors, following their poor performance, are shifting to a newer project, Flasko.

Flasko is still in its presale stage and has shown the potential to deliver outstanding results in 2023.

Solana (SOL) Is Not Delivering Profits Anymore

Solana (SOL) is a 4th generation cryptocurrency. It is based upon an open infrastructure, with the objective of boosting quantifiability.

Solana (SOL) is quite an impressive cryptocurrency network as well. Solana (SOL) is using the latest available technology to deliver unprecedented data transferring speeds and enterprise-grade security to users.

Since Solana (SOL) came to the market in 2017, cryptocurrency has experienced rapid growth. However, the growth came to a halt along with its merger with Ethereum (ETH).

Dogecoin (DOGE) Is Not Doing Well For The Rest Of 2022 And 2023

Dogecoin (DOGE) is quite an old cryptocurrency. It was initially introduced to the crypto world back in the year 2013. In fact, the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto directly influenced in the creation of this meme coin.

Behind Dogecoin (DOGE), you can find the same algorithm behind Litecoin (LTC). However, there was no solid project backing up the cryptocurrency. People knew it as just another meme coin. From the beginning of 2022, Dogecoin (DOGE) has lost its overall value by around 24%. This will continue for the rest of 2022 and 2023 as well.

Flasko (FLSK) Will Be A Good Investment For 2023

Among different cryptocurrencies that show potential to grow in 2023, Flasko is making a noise in the crypto community.

Through Flasko, anyone will be able to purchase NFTsbacked up with real-world investments in premium luxury beverages such as wines, champagnes, and whiskeys.

The current value of Flasko is only $0.065. This is expected to grow by 4,000% in the year 2023. Therefore, investing in Flasko right now is indeed a good idea.

Since the investment is locked with liquidity for 33 years, Flasko would be one of the safest investments to consider.

Ainsi, en 7 jours, la capitalisation du memecoin a plus de doublé, au point de dépasser celle des blockchains Solana (SOL) et Cardano (ADA).

Grande semaine pour le Dogecoin (DOGE)

Cette semaine a été bonne pour l'ensemble des cryptomonnaies suite à une remontée du Bitcoin (BTC), résultat de la conjonction de facteurs économiques favorables, notamment suite à la publication de résultats trimestriels positifs pour la plupart des grandes entreprises américaines. Mais malgré cette remontée quasi générale, certaines cryptomonnaies sortent encore du lot.

C'est le cas du Dogecoin (DOGE), cette cryptomonnaie créée en 2013, qui ne devait jamais être plus qu'une simple blague. Et pourtant, à l'heure de l'écriture de ces lignes, le DOGE siège à la 8e place du classement des cryptomonnaies en termes de capitalisation boursière.

Effectivement, là où le BTC et l'Ether (ETH) ont respectivement gagné 7,7 % et 21,6 %, le DOGE a surperformé le reste du marché et affiche une progression fulgurante de 111% sur la même période.

Ainsi, la désormais célèbre cryptomonnaie à l'effigie d'un Shiba Inu a pu bénéficier de l'élan général du marché, mais également de l'achat de la plateforme Twitter par Elon Musk, une acquisition qui aurait pu se régler devant les tribunaux, mais qui a finalement été finalisée cette semaine.

Effectivement, le DOGE est bien connu pour être la cryptomonnaie favorite du milliardaire, au point même qu'il soit parfois possible de l'utiliser comme moyen de paiement chez Tesla, entreprise dont Elon Musk est le PDG.

Une hausse passagère ?

Le Dogecoin a ainsi profité d'un élan tout à fait remarquable, et prouve également que son cours reste très corrélé à divers facteurs extérieurs peu prévisibles, ce qui provoque des vagues d'achat soudaines. Aussi, lorsque nous jetons un œil à l'indicateur Relative Strenght Index (RSI), nous pouvons constater que le DOGE a été largement suracheté sur la semaine.

Cours du DOGE, avec la zone de surachat délimitée au-dessus de 70 sur la partie inférieure de la capture d'écran

Bien que cela n'augure pas nécessairement une baisse de son cours aussi soudaine que sa récente hausse, cela peut au moins laisser présager une correction ou une volatilité amoindrie à court terme de ce dernier.

En parallèle d'une hausse générale du volume de trading sur le DOGE, nous pouvons également constater une hausse importante du nombre de transactions pour les whales.

Nombre de transactions sur le DOGE avec un montant supérieur à 100 000 dollars

Par conséquent, la capitalisation boursière du DOGE s'est également accrue de façon considérable. Effectivement, cette dernière dépassait tout juste les 8 milliards de dollars en début de semaine et a plus de doublé sur la semaine, jusqu'à atteindre les 19,8 milliards de dollars lors de son point le plus haut au 29 octobre. La capitalisation du DOGE a toutefois continué de grimper de plus de 17,5 % sur les dernières 24 heures.

Ainsi, le DOGE a dépassé la capitalisation boursière de Solana (SOL) et de Cardano (ADA), ce qui, encore une fois, le place à la 8e place du podium des cryptomonnaies.

A closer look at the best altcoins to invest in 2023

Considering just how many digital currencies are now in circulation – choosing the best altcoins for your portfolio is no easy feat. You’ll also need to choose the best altcoin exchange with the lowest fees.

You’ll need to research key metrics surrounding the goals of the project, its historical price action, current market capitalisation, and more. with this in mind, the sections below offer a full analysis of the overall best altcoins to invest in this year:

1. Ethereum

Ethereum is overall the best altcoin to buy today. Ethereum needs no introduction, as the blockchain network has become the go-to for decentralised application (dapp) developers worldwide. Ethereum’s network provides the foundation for these apps, thanks to its smart contract functionality. These smart contracts remove the middleman from certain transactions, making the process entirely decentralised. Considering ethereum’s use cases and massive rallies it’s done, it definitely is one of the hottest cryptocurrency to buy right now.

Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation. it’s the biggest altcoin, and went on a massive bull run in 2021, reaching its current all-time high (ath) of $4,840. The coin has made new lows since then, but the project’s future has given investors hope of another price spike.

Some analysts predict that ethereum will reach $12,000 by 2025. That will mean that the ethereum bull run will last for at least four years, since it started in 2021. Anything is possible, but we have to use the history of the crypto market to base our decision and the crypto market has never been in a four-year bull run and without massive crashes.

2. Apecoin (ape)

The best new altcoin to invest in 2023 is apecoin. Many investors believe that apecoin is the hottest cryptocurrency for 2023, thanks to the coin’s link to the super-popular bored ape yacht club (bayc) nft collection. Bayc is undoubtedly one of the best nfts to buy and has achieved cult status within the market. This status has aided apecoin, helping its price surge over 270 per cent in the weeks following its listing.

Apecoin could be the hottest cryptocurrency to buy due to its price potential, which will be heavily influenced by its ‘meme’ status. However, apecoin also has various use cases, such as being used in ‘the otherside’. This is the bayc creators’ latest project and looks set to be one of the best metaverse platforms of 2023.

Ape has also been integrated into several blockchain-based games, such as the popular benji bananas platform. Furthermore, since apecoin is structured as a dao, the token holders have the final say regarding governance. Although its price has fallen recently, apecoin remains one of the hottest altcoins of the year.

3. The sandbox

the next crypto to explode from our list of the best altcoins to buy in 2023 is the sandbox. in a nutshell, this project specialises in the metaverse, whereby players from all over the world can explore the sandbox ecosystem while communicating and networking.

Within the sandbox metaverse, users can create and personalise their own character, which can then be used to compete in play to earn games. This means that when certain tasks are accomplished, users can earn the platform’s in-game currency – sand. What we also like about the sandbox is that it is home to an abundance of nfts.

For instance, the sandbox allows you to use your sand tokens to buy plots of land. You can then build property on this land and attempt to sell the respective nft on the open marketplace. As a prime example of how lucrative this can be, a sandbox user recently sold 100 virtual islands for the crypto-equivalent of $4.2 million.

In terms of how sand has performed in the market itself, this altcoin has generated huge returns since it was launched. According to coinmarketcap, the sandbox was initially priced at $0.05 in mid-2020. This altcoin last peaked in november 2021, whereby a price of over $8.40 was breached.

And as such, this translates into gains of over 16,000 per cent. Not bad for just over one year of trading. With that being said, and like most altcoins in this industry, sand has since retreated in value. As of writing, you can buy this top-rated altcoin at a heavily discounted price of under $3 per token.

4. Theta (theta)

Did you know that theta is one of the most undervalued altcoin and best utility cases in 2023?

Those who invest in cryptocurrency regularly may have heard of theta, which has burst onto the scene over the past year. Theta is considered one of the best new crypto coins because it aims to revolutionise how video streaming works. TAhis is accomplished by making the process decentralised rather than centralised (as is the case with youtube).

Content creators will get paid for sharing videos in tfuel – one of the theta network’s native tokens. The network uses the theta token for governance, although it can also be used for staking, which exchanges it into tfuel. Finally, theta has already garnered investment from leading companies like sony and samsung, highlighting why it is the top crypto altcoin on our list.

>>>Buy theta now<<<

Virtual currencies are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk.

5. Ftx token (ftt)

Another one of the best new altcoin to consider adding to your portfolio is ftx token. Ftx has emerged as one of the best crypto exchanges in the last few years, offering over 300 cryptocurrencies for users to trade. Like other exchanges, Ftx has its own native cryptocurrency called ‘Ftx token’, which is used to enhance the user experience.

iIt's a top altcoin to buy and has various use cases within the Ftx ecosystem, such as being used to reduce trading fees and staking. Ftx token is also used as collateral for futures positions since the platform focuses heavily on derivatives.

However, those looking to buy cryptocurrency for speculative reasons can also purchase FtT to gain exposure to the Ftx platform’s growth. Ftt’s price rose a staggering 2,290 per cent between november 2020 and september 2021, reaching an all-time high of $85. Although the price is well below that now, this highlights the token’s potential if a rebound were to occur.

6. Yearn.finance

Another great altcoin to buy and invest in decentralised financial services is Yearn.finance. We are huge proponents of the business model employed by Yearn.finance – which specialises in decentralised financial services. Put simply, the platform connects borrowers and investors – meaning that there is no longer a requirement for a third-party intermediary. Instead, crypto loans at Yearn.finance are facilitated loans via automated smart contracts.

iBy its basic form, borrowers are required to put up a certain amount of collateral in the form of digital tokens. In return, the smart contract will then allow the user to borrow an amount of capital against the said collateral. And, in addition to returning the funds back within an agreed timeframe, the borrower will also be required to pay interest.

At the other end of the transaction, you have investors. Said investors will deposit funds into the Yearn.finance ecosystem, which is then used to facilitate loans. In turn, investors will be paid a yield on their capital outlay – with the specific apy design on a variety of factors – such as the respective token and lending terms.

If you like the sound of this top-rated defi coin project, you can easily buy Yearn.finance from the comfort of your home. This is the case even though Yearn.finance is one of the most expensive altcoins in the market. For instance, the digital currency hit highs of over $90,000 in 2021 – making it even more valuable than bitcoin in token terms.

With that said, you can invest from just $10 into Yearn.finance when using etoro. Nevertheless, in terms of its performance, Yearn.finance and its yti token were initially priced at just under $1,000 in 2020 – as per coinmarketcap. Moving into 2023, the same altcoin is trading at less than $19,000. This means that since it was launched, this altcoin has grown by over 1,800 per cent.

>>>Buy altcoins now<<<

Virtual currencies are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk.

7. Cosmos

If you haven’t previously come across the term interoperability, in the traditional computing industry this refers to two or more systems having the capacity to communicate with one another. In the cryptocurrency arena, interoperability, therefore, refers to the challenges faced by different blockchain networks that may have the need to share data.

These challenges have, however, since been allocated with the growth of cosmos and its atom token. In a nutshell, cosmos provides the required technology for the likes of bitcoin and cardano or eos and ripple to collect and share data. This means that in theory, ethereum smart contracts can make decisions based on specific bitcoin transactions.

And, in order for competing blockchains to use this innovative technology, the atom token is required. And as such, this is why atom is one of the best-performing altcoins of recent years. As per coinmarketcap, atom was priced at just $7.50 back in early 2019. as of early 2022, atom breached a price of $43 per token.

And as such, this represents very healthy gains of over 480 per cent in just under three years of trading activity. With that being said, cosmos and its native atom token have since dropped in value in line with the wider altcoin marketplace. As such, you can now get your hands on this altcoin at a bargain price of under $30 per token.

8. Uniswap

Another top-rated project that makes our list of the best altcoins to buy in 2023 is uniswap. Founded in 2018, uniswap was one of the first exchanges to introduce the concept of decentralised trading. In a nutshell, this means that people can now buy and sell altcoins without needing to go through a centralised exchange.

If you’re wondering how this is possible, there are certain innovative factors at play. First and foremost, uniswap does not rely on traditional bid/ask order books to create a safe and fair trading space for the generation of sufficient levels of liquidity. On the contrary, uniswap uses an amm – or automated market maker model.

Put simply, the amm model determines altcoin prices based on a variety of factors – such as demand, volume, and market capitalisation. In addition to decentralised trading services, uniswap also gives you the opportunity to earn a yield on your idle altcoins.

This is because you can provide the uniswap amm with liquidity, which in turn, will generate interest in your deposit. Moreover, you can invest in the broader uniswap ecosystem by purchasing its uni token – which is one of the most popular altcoins to buy right now.

According to coinmarketcap, the uni token was trading at just under $7 in late 2020. After going through a somewhat rocky ride in the following few months, uniswap then went on a rapid upside trend. In fact, the uni token hit highs of just over $44 in mid-2021 – which translates into gains of more than 500 per cent.

9. Decentraland

If you have an interest in the future of metaverse coins, then you might have liked the sound of the sandbox – which we analysed above. With that said, decentraland is also one of the best altcoins to buy in 2023 if this niche marketplace is something you wish to gain exposure to.

This super-popular project – which was founded in 2017, is now used by thousands of people each and every day. These numbers continue to grow and perhaps, most importantly, so does the number of transactions being conducted in the decentraland ecosystem. More specifically, decentraland has facilitated some huge digital real estate trades in recent months.

For example, in late 2021, an area within the decentraland metaverse known as fashion street estate, sold for a reported $2.4 million. Crucially, decentraland allows users of all budgets to buy plots of land, which then can be used to build real estate projects. And in turn, each project can then be sold on the decentraland nft marketplace.

Each and every transaction executed within the decentraland ecosystem is conducted in the platform’s native altcoin – mana. And with this in mind, it goes without saying that mana has performed extremely well since it was launched in late 2017. As per stats extracted from coinmarketcap, you would have originally paid just $0.025 per mana token.

When the project last peaked in late 2021 with the wider metaverse scene, mana was trading at over $5.90. This means that those buying into this project in late 2017 would have been looking at end-to-end profits in excess of 23,000 per cent. As such, a mere investment of just $500 would have translated into a portfolio worth over $115,000.

>>>Buy altcoins now<<<

Virtual currencies are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk.

10. Solana

Solana, alongside a number of other altcoins, is often referred to as an ethereum killer. This means that many market commentators believe that solana could one day overtake ethereum as the leading smart contract platform. But is solana a good investment? the main reason for this is that the solana blockchain is significantly more efficient in terms of speed, scalability, and fees.

For example, in its current form, ethereum is only able to facilitate an average of 16 transactions per second. In comparison, the solana blockchain can reportedly handle over 65,000 transactions per second. Moreover, you might be aware of the ongoing issues that ethereum has with respect to high fees.

In a nutshell, transactions taking place on the ethereum blockchain – no matter how small, average $4 as of writing. This means that ethereum is not suitable for processing micro-transactions – which is crucial in the smart contract scene. In comparison, solana is able to process transactions at less than 1/1000th of a cent, making it one of the greenest cryptocurrency.

The aforementioned capabilities of the solana blockchain has resulted in its native altcoin – sol, becoming a top-10 cryptocurrency project in terms of market capitalisation. Looking at the price performance of sol, coinmarketcap notes that it was priced at just $0.78 in early 2020.

Since then, solana has breached highs of over $260. To put this rapid growth into perspective, this represents gains of over 33,000 per cent in just under two years of trading. Moving into 2023, however, solana has since hit lows of $80-ish, which means that now could be a great time to enter the market. There’s no doubt that solana is one of the hottest cryptocurrency to buy right now.

What are altcoins?

The term altcoin is an abbreviated way of discussing alternative coins to bitcoin. This means that of the 18,000+ digital tokens listed on coinmarketcap, each and every project can be classified as an altcoin – apart from btc.

And as such, this means that you have a significant number of altcoins to consider for your cryptocurrency portfolio. It is important to note that altcoins will vary considerably in terms of the project and roadmap targets, market capitalisation, historical performance, and legitimacy.

As a result, knowing which altcoins to buy can be challenging. For instance, while the likes of shiba inu and bnb have generated life-changing returns since being launched, many altcoins have since lost over 95 per cent in value. Therefore, when deciding on which altcoins to buy for 2023, you will need to do lots of homework.

Virtual currencies are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk.

Are altcoins a good investment?

If you’re wondering whether you should buy altcoins or just stick with bitcoin, this section is for you. Within it, we discuss some of the main reasons why you might consider investing in a selection of top-rated altcoins today.

Many altcoins have generated life-changing returns

First and foremost, perhaps the main reason why you might consider buying a selection of altcoins today is that many projects have generated life-changing returns.

We gave some examples earlier in our analysis of the best altcoins for 2023, but allow us to elaborate further.

For example, we mentioned just a moment ago that when bnb was launched in late 2017, a single token was worth just $0.11.

And, as of writing, the project is carrying 52-week highs of $690.

This equates to end-to-end gains in excess of 690,000 per cent. and as such, had you invested just $1,000, at its peak, your money would have been worth $6.9 million.

In another example, we also mentioned that decentraland and its mana token has since witnessed growth of 23,000 per cent. And therefore, a $1,000 investment into this altcoin would have been worth over $230,000.



With that said, and as we covered earlier, not all altcoins will perform as well as the likes of bnb and decentraland – so it’s important that you set yourself realistic expectations before you make a purchase.

Altcoins outperform bitcoin

It is not only altcoins that have generated life-changing returns since launching. After all, it is important to remember that when bitcoin was first launched in 2009, it was worth just a small fraction of $0.01 per token. And, when you consider that bitcoin has since hit highs of over $68,000 – this represents end-to-end gains in the millions of percentage points.

However, bitcoin has since become a multi-trillion dollar asset class, so it goes without saying that the upside potential will be limited from hereon. In fact, when you compare the performance of bitcoin over the prior few years with that of top-rated altcoins, btc isn’t as attractive as it once was.

For example, in the prior 12 months since writing this page, the price of bitcoin has decreased by over 20 per cent. in comparison, ethereum has increased by nearly 50 per cent. over a 5-year period, bitcoin has increased by 3,600 per cent, while ethereum has witnessed gains of more than 7,000 per cent.

As such, if your main priority is to target high-performing crypto assets, then altcoins might be more suitable for your risk appetite when compared with bitcoin.

Easy to diversify

Another major benefit of adding the best altcoins to your portfolio is that you can easily diversify to help mitigate the risk of loss. This is something that most traders and investors adhere to when learning how to trade cryptocurrency.

Sure, on the one hand, the cryptocurrencies market often moves in sync with one another, meaning that when bitcoin does well, so do altcoins. However, it also goes without saying that some altcoins have performed considerably better than others.

And as such, you can give yourself the best chance possible of choosing the best-performing altcoins by adding a wide selection of tokens to your portfolio.

This can be achieved easily when you use an online broker that not only offers small minimum investment requirements, but also a large number of supported markets.

For instance, at the sec-regulated broker etoro, you will have access to dozens of leading altcoins at a minimum trade value of just $10 per token.

Many altcoins are cheap

Another reason why bitcoin – or even ethereum for that matter, is somewhat unattractive to value investors is that these tokens are now trading for a huge amount of money.

After all, bitcoin and ethereum have since breached highs of approximately $68,000 and $5,000 respectively. This means that by investing a modest amount of money, you will likely only be able to purchase a tiny fraction of one token.

However, when researching the best altcoins for 2023, we came across a number of notable projects that still carry a low entry price.

For example, we mentioned earlier that by investing just $100 into shiba inu, you can get yourself about 5 million tokens.

Similarly, if you were to invest $100 into basic attention token, this would get you over 800 tokens as of writing.

Crucially, although the price of an altcoin doesn’t dictate its total valuation alone, it can be a lot more attractive to invest in a cryptocurrency project that allows you to own a large number of tokens – as opposed to a small fraction.

Huge upside potential

Many experienced traders will also seek out the best altcoins in the market because in many cases, the upside potential can be huge as we have witnessed the sharp increase in shiba inu and dogecoin in 2021.

For example, once you skip through the first few hundred projects in terms of market capitalisation, you will come across thousands of altcoins that carry a valuation of less than $10 million. And as such, this means that the upside potential on these altcoins is going to be much higher than those that already have a large-cap status.

Another thing to be aware of when buying low-cap altcoins is that those with a considerably small market valuation will be a lot more volatile. This is because of the fundamentals of market depth, which means that smaller-cap assets are easier to move in the market.

Innovation outside of financial payments

We also like altcoins for the innovation that some projects have since introduced to the cryptocurrency sector. Sure, bitcoin itself is revolutionary. But, the network is only able to facilitate global payments.

In the case of the best altcoins that we came across, some of the most notable projects offer the following:

Decentraland and the sandbox both offer virtual 3d worlds that allow users to buy plots of land and real estate, and then sell these in the open market via nfts.

Cosmos is solving the issue of blockchain interoperability.

Solana is looking to challenge ethereum’s dominance of smart contracts, with super-fast, scalable, and low-cost transactions.

The above examples are just a few of many. the key point is that by investing in an altcoin that offers something different from the status quo, there is every chance that the respective token will perform well.

Where to buy altcoins

When deciding on where to buy altcoins for your portfolio, we would suggest exploring the following metrics before you open an account with your chosen exchange or broker:

Is the platform regulated by a reputable licensing body such as the fca or sec?

What altcoins does the platform give you access to?

What fees and commissions will you need to pay to buy your chosen altcoins?

Where does the platform stand in terms of customer service and supported payment methods?

What is the minimum amount of money you will need to risk to buy altcoins at the platform?

Taking the above metrics into account, we found that etoro is the overall best place to buy altcoins in 2023. We explain why in the section below.

>>>Buy altcoins now<<<

Virtual currencies are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk.

Etoro – best place to buy altcoins in 2023

Etoro is our pick for the best crypto platform that is ideal for investors of all skill sets. Opening an account here takes minutes – and the kyc verification process can be completed instantly. We like the fact that etoro is regulated by multiple bodies – including the sec, asic, fca, and cysec.

This means that you can buy altcoins without needing to worry about the safety of your funds – which can’t be said for many exchanges in this space. Clients can deposit funds in usd without paying any fees. Crucially, this is the case not only with ach and domestic bank wires but e-wallets like paypal and even debit/credit cards.

And, if you’re a new customer from the us, you only need to deposit $10 to get started. In terms of supported altcoins, etoro lists dozens of leading crypto assets. For example, you can buy dogecoin on etoro with a fee of just 1% which is then added to the tight bid-ask spread. This includes everything from yearn.finance, uniswap, tron, and the sandbox to decentraland, bnb, and compound coin. When you buy altcoins at this brokerage, the minimum stake is a mere $10.

You will also save on traditional trading commissions when you buy altcoins via the etoro website, as you only need to cover the spread. This starts at 0.75% on bitcoin but will be ever-so-slightly higher when trading altcoins. We also like etoro for its diversification tools, which include professionally-managed portfolios that contain a wide range of altcoins. For example, you could invest in ethereum with competitive fees.

This particular investment product will suit time-starved investors or those with little to no experience in performing technical analysis. Etoro is also home to copy trading tools, so again, this will appeal to those seeking a passive investment experience. When it comes to customer service, etoro offers a live chat facility – so there is no need to wait around for an email reply.

We also like etoro as the best crypto app for the free virtual portfolios that it offers to both new and existing clients. This comes pre-loaded with $100,000, which you can then use to trade altcoins in a risk-free environment. Once you have registered an etoro account, you might also consider downloading the ios/android app.

Conclusion - the best altcoins to buy now

Altcoins offer the potential to make attractive returns on your cryptocurrency investments – especially when you consider that you’ve likely missed the boat on bitcoin.

After all, bitcoin has already surpassed a total market valuation of over $1 trillion, so returns will be somewhat limited when compared to smaller-cap altcoins.

2022-10-31 12:43:36.339574,Cointelegraph,"5,000 miles apart: Thailand and Hungary to jointly explore blockchain tech","The financial technology associations for Thailand and Hungary have signed a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to support the introduction of blockchain technology to their respective financial sectors.

The MOU, signed by the Thai Fintech Association (TFA) and the Hungarian Blockchain Coalition on Oct. 25, will see the two associations “share experiences, best practices and explore areas potentially beneficial for direct cooperation,” according to a Facebook post by the Embassy of Hungary in Bangkok.

TFA president Chonladet Khemarattana said that e-commerce, mobile payments, and digital currencies are growing rapidly in Thailand and that international cooperation is needed to further develop local financial technology, according to an Oct. 29 report from the Bangkok Post.

He also claimed 20% of the world’s crypto holders are in Thailand, the country placed eighth on the 2022 Global Crypto Adoption Index released in September by analytics firm Chainalysis and crypto payments company TripleA estimates almost 6.5% of the population owns cryptocurrency,

The Hungarian Blockchain Coalition was jointly created by the country’s Ministry of Innovation and Technology and the National Data and Economy Knowledge Centre in March 2022, while the Thai Fintech Association is a nonprofit founded in 2016 with the aim of representing the local financial technology industry including cryptocurrency exchanges.

The pact comes as Thailand’s central bank, along with some of the country’s commercial banks, were involved in the testing of a cross-border wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) transaction platform using distributed ledger technology in September.

The Bank of Thailand also announced in August it was looking to start a pilot of a retail CBDC by the end of 2022 at a limited scale in the private sector among roughly 10,000 users. It would test the digital currency using “cash-like activities” such as paying for goods or services.

Meanwhile, Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has enacted some restrictions on crypto this year, with it banning the use of cryptocurrencies for payments in March, saying they “could affect the stability of the financial system.”

The regulator is also cracking down on crypto lending platforms, with the SEC planning to prohibit crypto exchanges from providing or supporting digital asset depository services.

Hungary seemingly takes a similar hard stance on cryptocurrencies. In February, the governor of the Hungarian National Bank, György Matolcsy, wanted a blanket ban on all crypto trading and mining across the European Union, saying it “serviced illegal activities” and was “speculative.”","The financial technology associations for Thailand and Hungary have signed a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to support the introduction of blockchain technology to their respective financial sectors.

CAUAYAN CITY: Seven gates of the Magat Dam in Ramon, Isabela were opened on Sunday, releasing 4,252 cubic meters per second as heavy rains continued to pound Cagayan Valley, the National Irrigation Administration-Magat River Integrated Irrigation System said.

The floodwaters also brought the Buntun Bridge water level to critical, threatening massive flooding in Cagayan and Isabela.

Landslides closed major roads such as the Nueva Vizcaya-Benguet Road in Castillo village in Kayapa, Nueva Vizcaya area, the DPWH-Nueva Vizcaya Second Engineering District said.

Ten towns were affected by landslides and floods in Isabela, including Ilagan City, Tumauini, Cabagan, Santa Maria, San Pablo, Santo Tomas, Quirino, Burgos, Gamu, Cauayan City, Benito Soliven, San Mariano and Naguilian, civil defense reports showed. Initial reports said 6,000 families with 15,000 people affected.

In Cagayan, 12 towns have been affected by floods including Tuguegarao City, Enrile, Baggao, Sta Praxedes, Pamplona, Sta. Ana, Lasam, Ballesteros, Rizal, Solana, Lal-lo and Piat. At least 734 families or 2,309 families have been evacuated.

Engineer Gileu Michael Dimoloy, National Irrigation Administration-Magat River Integrated Irrigation System department manager, said in an online news briefing on Sunday that the swelling of the Cagayan River is not mainly attributable to the water released by the dam but also its tributaries.

He warned villagers floods may occur in 16 hours.

He noted that the volume of dam water releases was lesser than Typhoon ""Ulysses"" in 2020, which reached 7,000 cubic meters per second in seven gates.","Rice farms were flooded in Gosi Norte, Tuguegarao City on Sunday, Oct. 30, 2022.

2022-10-31 07:43:36.352480,The Cryptonomist,When crypto meet the metaverse,"Listen this article download

The reason why the metaverse has taken off, especially in the past two years, is definitely related to the explosion of the NFT market and the latest bull run in the crypto sector.

This has given the metaverse the opportunity to expand rapidly, creating a real economy around it.

What is the metaverse and what is its relationship to crypto?

The metaverse is still something that many do not agree on in terms of meaning and definition, but the first characteristics are beginning to emerge.

They are three-dimensional spaces where users move freely using avatars to play, create, work and even make business deals.

Virtual spaces can be created by users themselves who make them available to other users.

Crypto, and sometimes fiat currencies, can be used.

Underlying virtual spaces are compatible technical standards, protocols, interoperability, digital ownership, blockchain technology, and laws governing their use.

Virtual real estate: can you invest in the metaverse?

The answer is yes: land in the metaverse is the new way to invest in the digital world, especially with crypto.

The research firm specializing in blockchain, Chainalysis, reported that virtual real estate prices grew 879% between September 2019 and March 2022. This was the period when Bitcoin yielded less than half, 362% (after the most recent collapse, as of 1 July 2022, it dropped to +98%).

According to Chainalysis’ report, buying via crypto or cryptocurrency a virtual space in the metaverse accesses some immediate benefits and others visible in the future.

By buying land in the metaverse, you can take advantage of video content, images, in-game single-player or multiplayer activities, and events.

What the metaverse will be able to offer is partly something imaginable even on future scenarios: the spaces purchased in the metaverse can certainly be rented and augmented reality tools, such as VR viewers, could be added.

Today, however, the majority of projects are in virtual reality with few links to the real world.

As far as the real estate sector of the metaverse is concerned, we are beginning to see differences related to the pricing field. According to Chainalysis, it all stems from the platform that binds to the metaverse: real estate on the Ethereum blockchain expects much higher prices than other crypto such as Solana.

The reason would stem from the fact that most Ethereum-based metaverses have recently integrated with Polygon, Ethereum’s sidechain competitor to Solana in both cost and speed performance.

One report noted:

“Since the metaverse is such a nascent space, the long-term value of blockchain-based virtual real estate depends on a number of external factors.” “While most of these factors are difficult to predict, we believe a couple of them may be,” the report says, “the possibility of AR/VR systems being more interoperable or proprietary and by the ‘pace of adoption of new information technologies.”

Microsoft, Meta, Google and other technology companies are implementing frameworks to form experiences in the metaverse but it is unknown whether the metaverse realities will be unique systems or integrated with one another.

Is it possible to buy NFTs and/or crypto related to the metaverse?

Most existing metaverses, such as Decentraland and The Sandbox, have their own tokens that power the virtual world economy.

These tokens can be purchased on the major centralized exchanges (CEX) where they are supported, or traded to other cryptocurrencies using decentralized exchanges (DEX).

In addition, each asset within the metaverse is represented by an NFT. Each digital asset can be purchased on the metaverse’s dedicated marketplace, if any, or on the secondary market by referring to platforms, such as OpenSea, Magic Eden, etc., where they are listed.

How does the purchase of NFTs for the metaverse with crypto take place?

In order to be able to proceed with one or more transactions, it is necessary to synchronize the wallet: in this way, the platform will be able to verify the presence of the necessary amount of crypto to be able to purchase.

The most popular wallets are those of Coinbase, MetaMask, Phantom and Trust Wallet.

NFTs in the metaverse

Since these are blockchain-based realities, it is inevitable that NFTs will find various applications within the metaverse. Indeed, each value here is represented by a token, and users have the ability to buy, trade, use and/or showcase their NFTs, sharing them with the community.

What is a wallet

A wallet is a virtual wallet within which to deposit, send and receive digital currency, such as Bitcoin, Dash, Ethereum, etc.

There are several types. The most popular are hardware ones that enjoy extreme security, such as Ledger; browser extensions, which are very simple and intuitive to use, such as MetaMask. And finally desktop ones, such as Exodus, or in-app format for smartphones.

How to open a wallet on MetaMask to buy NFTs

MetaMask is the most popular free wallet for buying NFTs: it is multi-chain in that it supports different blockchains, such as Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom and BNB Chain. It also allows interaction with almost all dApps. Its popularity is mainly due to its ease of use, since it is a browser extension.

To open it, you will need to open the MetaMask site and follow a few steps: simply add the extension to Chrome and then create a password and a seed phrase, a secret backup phrase.

When the wallet is set up, one can deposit a sufficient amount of crypto, usually Ether (ETH) to then purchase NFTs.

It also supports on-ramp for automatic fiat-crypto currency conversion using third-party services offered by Coinbase Pay, Wyre, Transak, and MoonPay.

Only after authorizing the connection between the wallet and the marketplace will it be possible to buy NFTs via MetaMask, based on prices set by the seller or by bidding via auction.

Once you have chosen the NFT to buy, you must click on “Make offer” or “Buy now” to proceed to the checkout stage.

MetaMask will then request a transaction signature to finalize the exchange.

At this point, the ownership of the token will be uniquely linked to the address with which the transaction was finalized. All assets held will be publicly viewable by accessing the “scans” of the relevant blockchain.","Virtual real estate: can you invest in the metaverse?

2022-10-31 05:43:36.366669,ABP LIVE,Cryptocurrency News Live: Top Coins See Minor Dips,"Cryptocurrency still remains a mystical subject for many keen investors in India. While cryptos are slowly gaining recognition from investors and regulators alike, with countries and leading brands adopting it as an official tender, there are still a sizeable number of people who wish to invest in crypto, but aren't able to closely track breaking and developing news in the sector, which will help them take note of price movements, major sell-offs, and announcements of new blockchain-based developments.

This live news blog is here to help. From major market losses to noteworthy declarations, follow this live blog to stay updated with all the latest happenings in the world of crypto.

While there are many cryptocurrencies to explore, Bitcoin (BTC) is the most popular as it is the world's oldest and most valued crypto coin. As of October 31, Bitcoin price stood at $20,525.24, as per CoinMarketCap data. At the time of writing, the global crypto market cap stood at $1.01 trillion, registering a dip of 1.29 per cent in the last 24 hours.

While cryptocurrency is unregulated in India, cryptocurrencies are clubbed under virtual digital assets (VDAs). Under the new tax regime that went into effect on April 1 this year, VDAs attract taxation of 30 per cent on gains. A TDS of 1 per cent is applied on top of that.

2022-10-31 07:43:36.377933,Tekedia,Rocketize Token: Topping Investors Watchlist In Combination With Fantom and Axie Infinity,"The functionality of a cryptocurrency is solely dependent on security and liquidity rate in creating lasting trust in an investor’s mindset. The blockchain industry and its project institute have been plagued with different system breaches and scams or fraudulent activities. The crime of infringement knows no bounds as it extends toward the most secure stablecoins and in-game currency for gaming industries like Solana (SOL). The cross-chain exchanges without ungraded fortification will prove weak to the challenge and lose public interest in their crypto projects.

There is an increased search for a cryptocurrency that will relatively improve investors’ interest in the DeFi space. The potential of the token must respond positively to standard communication and promotion strategies. The decentralized financial system and users must also generate massive profits from such a meme coin agenda. Lastly, the non-fungible token vision of the crypto network must be favoured by this coin. The very best option worth consideration is the Rocketize Token (JATO) project.

Rocketize Token: Detailed Agenda and Prospect

Rocketize tokens will ace the meme world with deflationary tokenomics that improve the equilibrium price through constraint force on circulating supply. The utility token for the ecosystem is JATO, meaning Jet-Assisted Take-Off. The Rocketize network is a perfect projection on its terms, and it’s equipped with objectives to create sustaining wealth for its community. The project is a community-driven agenda as developers and creators are monetarily reimbursed for their efforts without portion allotments on token supply.

The prospect of Rocketize networks has its navigation with 2% tax charges on every transaction. The JATO token proposes a directly proportional increase in demand and price as it cuts supply. Investors garnish more returns after the baby action, an aftermath of the launch. The utilization of the token as collateral is possible through decentralized finance (DeFi) for other smart contracts. Ideally, the conservative rate of DApps on the DeFi network is over 13%, far more than 0.5% of the centralized financial system. The promotion mechanism will be optimized through active and ever-growing community, meme culture, and social media.

Rocketize Token vs Fantom

The Fantom project is built to serve as an alternative medium for DApps in place of Ethereum. The open-sourced decentralized smart contract project is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with consensus algorithm services for developers. The in-house token for the Fantom ecosystem is FTM. The network is centred on two technologies, namely the Lachesis protocol and Opera. The protocol aspect allows high scalability among cross-chain exchanges without compromising network processes. To maintain network efficiency with maximum security and transaction speed, Fantom (FTM) platform proof-of-stake payment and leaderless validation are required. The Fantom (FTM) platform is compatible with Ethereum ERC-20 and BEP2 standards with reservations that serve as staking rewards.

Rocketize Token vs Axie Infinity

The players’ owned and controlled projects like Axie Infinity are rare in blockchain-based trading and battling games. The Axie Infinity gaming network is themed with an axies structure with body parts combinations that are variable and unique. The non-fungible token (NFT) is centred on the battle attributes that improve the winning team’s body parts and increase the participation stats. The players’ creativity will birth offspring that are marketable on Axie platforms. The utility and governance token for community members’ access to decision-making is known as Axie Infinity Shards (AXS).

Path Navigation to Purchasing Rocketize Token

The Rocketize ecosystem has started the presale of the $JATO token for potential investors and crypto users. With an equipped liquidity pool and the deflationary prospect of an increasing equilibrium price, the JATO total supply is projected as a unique marketable meme coin. Purchases can occur over cross-chain networks including Fantom, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain BSC to further DeFi space optimization. The speculated vesting period for Rocketize Token will last two months, a clarion call for early investors.

To Conclude

The combination of the DeFi and DAO mechanisms is a relative factor of the cryptocurrency system. The system will continue to yield millions in return for any investor that chooses the right portfolio to invest in. The market-attracting platform for potential investors is the Rocketize ecosystem in combination with Fantom and Axie Infinity.

ADA bulls had been making significant progress over the past 48 hours, as price moved up from a lowly $0.37 to $0.44. Over the past 24 hours, however, ADA faced a 5 percent decline to cause a test of the support zone at $0.35 once again. Price had moved into a saturation zone on the daily chart where the 24-hour RSI began to show an overbought state. Bulls will still look to target the $0.5 mark for November and could still find an uptrend before price touches the upper support floor at $0.38.

The larger cryptocurrency market showed similar signs of downtrends across the board, as major cryptocurrencies fell into the red state. Bitcoin dropped to $20,600, whereas Ethereum moved further away from the $2,000 mark with a 2 percent decline. Ripple also receded 2 percent to move down to $0.45, whereas Dogecoin dropped 10 percent after an impressive past 48 hours that saw price touch the $0.14 mark. Meanwhile, Solana and Polkadot dropped 2 percent each, to move down to $32.45 and $6.59, respectively.

The industry was more optimistic than usual this week. After nearly two months of weeklong price freezes or crashes, it appeared that things are finally starting to rally again.

This was also the week that Tesla CEO, institutional Bitcoin HODLer and Dogecoin-maxi Elon Musk finally closed his $44 billion Twitter acquisition bid. His new platform was a hive of commotion following the news; though MicroStrategy executive chairman (and fellow Bitcoin whale) Michael Saylor and Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao were the most welcoming.

Musk officially took over Twitter on Thursday evening and trolled followers with reports that he was already firing people. The two dejected and believable-looking “employees” pictured below were in fact professional trolls. Although Musk previously floated the idea of firing 75% of Twitter’s staff (around 5,000 people), this week, he appeared to have had cold feet on that proposal.

2022-10-31 06:43:36.678135,The Financial Express,Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter results profitable for Dogecoin holders,"Reportedly, billionaire Elon Musk, CEO, Tesla’s, acquisition of Twitter has resulted in the tipping of 62% Dogecoin (DOGE) investors into profit, during speculation that Musk’s acquisition of Twitter will result into positive developments for the meme token, as reported by Cointelegraph.

According to Cointelegraph, on October 26, 2022, DOGE’s price rallied on account of Musk altering his Twitter’s bio to “Chief of Twit,” the same day when he went to Twitter’s San Francisco-based headquarters before concluding the deal as the new owner on October 28, 2022. In the past one week, DOGE’s price went up 98.5% to $0.119, according to insights by CoinGecko.

On the basis of information by Cointelegraph, the insights meant that as much as 62% of DOGE holders are being able to clock funds at the current price, as reported by blockchain intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, which even showed going past Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) hodlers at 54% and 57%, respectively. It also reportedly triggered DOGE’s market capitalisation on account of surpassing smart contract platforms Cardano and Solana to become the eight largest cryptocurrency in the world with a $16.3 billion markey capitalisation, according to CoinGecko. It is believed that the connection between Musk’s Twitter purchase and DOGE’s price surge shouldn’t be a surprise as many Dogecoin investors have high hopes for Musk, for integration of Dogecoin onto Twitter in some shape or form. On October 28, 2022, Matt Wallace, Dogecoin fanatic and cryptocurrency blogger, informed his 678,400 followers about his belief that a Dogecoin-integrated Twitter can bring the potential of Dogecoin’s capability.

Moreover, Cointelegraph noted that Charles Hoskinson, founder and CEO, Cardano, stated about there being a possibility of Dogecoin integrating on to Twitter. Hoskinson also stated the offering of migrating Dogecoin on to Cardano as a sidechain with embedded smart contract functionality for free. In January, 2022, Tesla permitted acceptance of DOGE as a payment mechanism for merchandise purchases, with Musk also hinting at doing the same thing at SpaceX in May, 2022.

2022-10-31 11:43:36.692049,Del Mar Times,Long-delayed San Diego polystyrene foam ban could take effect in April,"Big changes may be coming in the spring for many San Diego restaurants and retail stores as city officials say they plan to follow through on a long-delayed ban on polystyrene foam food containers, coolers, pool toys and similar products.

City officials said the ban, which has been delayed nearly four years by litigation filed by restaurants and foam container companies, will take effect April 1 if the City Council approves it during a hearing scheduled for Tuesday, Nov. 15.

Prospects for approval got a boost Oct. 27 when the council’s Environment Committee voted 4-0 in favor of the ban, with Councilman Joe LaCava, the committee chairman, saying “San Diego is ready to say goodbye to polystyrene and single-use plastics.”

The committee’s approval “gets us one step closer to keeping these harmful materials out of our waste stream, beaches and waters,” LaCava, whose District 1 includes Carmel Valley, said in a statement.

The city’s move was praised by several environmental groups, who said foam products poison marine life and damage the health of people who eat seafood.

Such foam, often sold under the brand name Styrofoam, is not biodegradable and continuously breaks into steadily smaller pieces, which allows it to enter local waterways and easily get consumed by wildlife.

The San Diego law also would make it illegal for restaurants and delivery services to distribute plastic utensils or straws unless customers request them.

Councilwoman Marni von Wilpert said she would support San Diego eventually banning plastic straws entirely.

Councilwoman Jennifer Campbell said she would like to remove an exemption for foam bodyboards, contending that foam from the boards frequently ends up in the ocean despite protective coating designed to prevent that.

But neither of those suggestions is part of the legislation the council will consider in November.

The proposed city law would apply to egg cartons, coolers, ice chests, pool toys, dock floats and mooring buoys. Residents wouldn’t be able to use those products, and retail stores wouldn’t be able to sell them.

San Diego would join more than 130 other California cities with bans on polystyrene, including Carlsbad, Encinitas, Solana Beach, Del Mar and Imperial Beach.

San Diego also would become the largest city in California to ban foam. Los Angeles city officials say they plan to enact a similar ban this year. San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland already have bans.

Nearly all national and regional restaurant chains long ago stopped using polystyrene in response to lobbying from environmental groups and backlash from customers concerned that foam isn’t biodegradable.

But many taco shops, pizza parlors, convenience stores and other small businesses continue to use foam products to save money.

To soften the impact on those businesses, San Diego’s proposed ban includes delays and hardship exemptions.

Businesses with annual incomes of less than $500,000 would not need to comply with the ban for the first year after it takes effect.

There also are hardship exemptions for businesses that either can’t find a reasonable alternative to polystyrene or have entered long-term contracts for non-compliant products before the new city law takes effect.

City officials said they will take an education-first approach with businesses, with enforcement and fines coming only after warnings and other attempts to get businesses to comply.

San Diego is reviving the planned foam ban, which was initially adopted in January 2019, after litigation caused city officials to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the ban’s potential environmental effects.

The analysis concluded that the environmental benefits of banning the foam far outweigh a slight increase in truck pollution caused by the switch from foam to heavier paper products.

The lawsuit, filed by the California Restaurant Association and one of the nation’s largest manufacturers of foam takeout containers, suggested a study was needed to determine whether the environmental damage that could be caused by a switch to paper might outweigh the environmental benefits of the switch.

San Diego’s ban would complement new state legislation regarding foam and straws, city officials said.

SB 54 will restrict distribution of polystyrene foam in the state starting in 2025 if the recycling rate of the material doesn’t exceed 25 percent by then. AB 1276 restricts the distribution of single-use utensils and condiment packets.

Most altcoins have calmed following the gains from the end of the working week, with Dogecoin finally retracing slightly today. In contrast, BNB jumped to a multi-month high.

BTC Stopped at $21K

The primary cryptocurrency has been on a roll in the past several days, ever since it skyrocketed from $19,000 to over $20,000 last Tuesday. It even went as high as $21,000 in the following days before it retraced back down to $20,000 after the European Central Bank said it will raise the interest rates once more to a 13-year record.

However, the bulls stepped up once more and pushed BTC north again. As a result, the asset was closing down to $21,000 on Friday. It actually pumped briefly above that level on Saturday, registering a new seven-week high.

However, the low trading volumes on Sunday didn’t allow the cryptocurrency to climb higher, and it lost a few hundred dollars. As of now, the asset has dipped even further south and trades at around $20,500, with some analysts warning that there might be more pain on the horizon.

BTC’s market cap has gone down below $400 billion once more, and its dominance over the alts is still beneath 39%.

BNB Sees New Local Peak

The altcoins went through some notable gains as well, and some have continued to do so. Binance Coin is among today’s top performers, with an impressive 5% increase. As a result, BNB has soared above $320 for the first time since the middle of August. This is perhaps fueled by the return of the Binance launchpool.

Ethereum dipped below $1,600 earlier today but has returned above that level now. Dogecoin also retraced hard at one point, but it’s still the most significant gainer for the past week after the Musk-Twitter deal.

Solana and Polkadot are also well in the green, trading at $34 and $6.8, respectively.

Despite retracing slightly since yesterday, the overall crypto market cap is still well above $1 trillion as of now.","Bitcoin’s voyage above $21,000 was quickly halted by the bears, and the asset has returned to just under that level.

Bitcoin lost 0.91%, while Elon Musk’s favourite, Dogecoin slipped 9.04%.

By Jasmine Anand:

On 31 October, a majority of the top cryptos were trading lower. At the time of writing this article (1030 IST), the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, stood at $20,564.36, down 0.91 percent in the past 24 hours. It seems the crypto is consolidated under the resistance of $21,000. Its closest rival, Ethereum, dipped by 1.80 percent and is currently priced at $1,589.92.

The performance of other top cryptos also dropped today. Prices of cryptos like XRP, Cardano, Polygon, Tron, Uniswap, and Litecoin fell by 1.57 percent, 2.99 percent, 1.99 percent, 1.89 percent, 4.93 percent, and 2.05 percent, respectively, at the time of writing. However, cryptos like Solana, Polkadot, Avalanche, and Cosmos were trading in the green today.

The global crypto market cap stood at $1.01 trillion, losing 1.23 percent over the previous day; however, the total crypto market volume decreased by 18.98 percent to $73.08 billion.

Today’s top gainer was Chiliz, rising by 15.08 percent, while Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, Waves, and Klaytn were among the top losers.

Meme coins

Today, meme tokens were witnessing a dip in their prices. Shiba Inu lost 9.70 percent and Dogecoin, which is presently trading at $0.1232, has dipped by 9.04 percent over the last day. However, the latter swelled by 107.23 percent since the past week. Here, it must be pointed out that Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, has been a huge advocate of Dogecoin and DOGE witnessed price gains following Musk’s takeover of Twitter last week.

Metaverse tokens

Metaverse tokens showed mixed trends. While tokens like The Sandbox, Decentraland, and Enjin Coin were trading higher today, ApeCoin and Axie Infinity witnessed price dips.

2022-10-31 12:43:37.032164,The San Diego Union-Tribune,Column: 49ers’ McCaffrey starts to make good on John Lynch’s Super Bowl bet,"Christian McCaffrey soared like he had vaulted off a trampoline, enabling the new 49ers star to haul in Jimmy Garoppolo’s nosediving spiral for a go-ahead touchdown Sunday that gutted the Los Angeles Rams.

McCaffrey, in going up, up, up for the 9-yard catch late in the third quarter, resembled an All-Pro receiver. On the former Hollywood Park race track grounds, the snag cemented the second piece of a trifecta performance, the 2019 All-Pro running back also throwing and rushing for touchdowns in a 31-14 victory.

You need stars to go far in the NFL, as the Rams showed last winter, and McCaffrey’s TD catch served as a metaphor for where San Francisco — a San Diego-infused, perennial NFC title contender — could go if their often-broken new toy can stay intact.

Solana Beach product John Lynch Jr., the Niners’ general manager, hugged colleagues inside a Kroenke Dome suite when McCaffrey, a 5-foot-11 fellow Stanford alum who rose 37.5 inches in the 2017 NFL Combine’s vertical-jump test, kangarooed off the carpet to send the team to a 21-17 lead.

Ten days earlier, Lynch and coach Kyle Shanahan traded four draft picks for McCaffrey, liberating him from last-place Carolina.

It was an obvious declaration: Lynch believed McCaffrey could facilitate a Super Bowl run while helping to blunt injuries to several frontliners who are expected to return this season.

Know this: despite their recent ugly moments, the 49ers (4-3) can beat the NFC East-leading Eagles (7-0) and West-leading Seahawks (5-3) and any other team in the increasingly forgiving NFC.

Adding a healthy McCaffrey is like adding two players and increasing the coaching staff’s IQ, given his versatility. He rushed for 94 yards (5.2) per carry. He passed for a 34-yard score after his run threat suckered a Rams defensive back. He caught eight passes for 55 yards. He lit fuses as a decoy.

Shanahan, not playing scared, rammed him into the line a few times but mostly tapped into his open-field prowess. McCaffrey appeared at shotgun running back, pistol I-back, conventional I-back, slot receiver and — setting up his TD catch — split end.

San Diego’s Fred Warner (Mission Hills) led the second-half shutout, sacking Rams QB Matthew Stafford and breaking up a pass. With Warner as their playcaller, the Niners have kept the Rams under 20 points six times within the eight-game, regular-season winning streak between West rivals.

University of San Diego alum Ross Dwelley joined the party, running uncovered for a 56-yard catch, leading to the final TD.

No point in flogging the Rams (4-4). They’re far less talented than a year ago.

Squeezing two glasses of juice from half an orange, L.A. did well to take a 14-10 lead into the second half via coach Sean McVay’s clever, screen-heavy designs, Stafford outplaying Jimmy G, and receiver Allen Robinson winning favorable matchups created by Cooper Kupp and McVay.

For the Rams to overcome not only three indisputably subpar units — offensive line, running backs and tight end (where Tyler Higbee struggled with an injury, dealt by a Niners safety’s clean, vicious hit) — they couldn’t afford Jalen Ramsey’s two drops of Garoppolo passes or for McCaffrey’s third-quarter fumble to land in a Niner’s hands.

The only Super Bowl candidate that exited the Kroenke Dome was the one wearing red and gold and reveling in the new-car smell — a Ferrari with no warranty — at running back.

DOGE has surged by 120% in the last 7 days and Shiba Inu has moved higher by 31% as well. Other digital currencies such as Binance Coin (BNB) and Cardano (ADA) have also moved higher by over 15% during the same period of time.

Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Skyrocket as Elon Musk Takes Over Twitter

Elon Musk has started a new bullish period of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu as these two virtual currencies registered massive gains in recent days. At the end of last week, Elon Musk closed a deal to take over Twitter and some changes are already visible on the social media network.

Elon Musk has been a key supporter of Dogecoin over the last few years. He is considered to be one of the most influential figures in the crypto market, and his declarations, have many times moved the market, affecting especially DOGE. Investors in the crypto market are now waiting for further integrations between Twitter and DOGE or even Bitcoin.

Nevertheless, Bitcoin has lagged behind altcoins during the last 7 days. For example, the digital currency has moved higher just by 8.5% during this time. This shows that market players are paying close attention to what is happening with DOGE and Shiba Inu (or other digital assets) rather than on Bitcoin. These are usually speculative moves that help short-term investors bet on the price movement of DOGE and SHIB.

Dogecoin has now reached a price per coin of $0.1297 per coin and a market capitalization of $18 billion, surpassing Cardano, Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC). This shows the strength that DOGE gained in recent days. At the same time, if it continues to move higher, we could see DOGE surpassing Binance USD (BUSD) and XRP.

While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are more related to social media trends and forum discussions (for example during the GameStop market manipulation in early 2021) than to fundamentals. Despite that, there are some positive things to mention about DOGE and SHIB. Dogecoin could get integrated into different Twitter solutions if Elon Musk decides to bring crypto to Twitter.

There will be a prioritization of DOGE rather than Bitcoin, which could bring additional flows to Dogecoin in the near future. The case for SHIB being used at Twitter is more limited though. SHIB usually follows DOGE’s trend but tends to lag behind with a few exceptions. Therefore, the market should be ready to see volatility in altcoins, especially DOGE and SHIB in the coming months.

Bitcoin, instead, is more correlated to macro economic trends linked to central banking and traditional finance. These are two different types of assets (BTC and DOGE), which require different analytical frameworks to understand what could happen to them. One thing is clear, if Bitocin moves higher, then other altcoins follow most of the times.

2022-10-31 05:43:37.045152,CryptoSlate,"Op-ed: Is SBF a superhero, villain or simply misunderstood by the crypto community?","FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is a controversial figure in the world of crypto, perhaps the most contentious following his recent statements on regulation. Over the past year, SBF has been in the trending section of CryptoSlate’s people directory almost weekly.

SBF, along with his companies Alameda Research and FTX, bailed out both BlockFi and Voyager following the collapse of Terra Luna. He also engaged with Celsius but chose not to invest in them due to holes in the balance sheets to the tune of $2 billion.

Through these activities, a few have hailed SBF as the savior of crypto, while others have pointed to possible personal motivations for his actions. The founder of Solana-based Solend, Rooter, called SBF “a profit maxi: profit at all costs.”

Below I attempt to address ‘What is SBF’s position on regulation?’ and whether he has been misunderstood.

Crypto regulation and SBF

Questions about SBF’s motivation for his public views on crypto regulation have been riding high over the past few weeks. SBF’s comments on DeFi revolved around blocklists, sanctions, consumer protection, hackers, and licensing for DeFi protocols. Most notably, SBF contended that marketing DeFi products to U.S. retail investors would likely require a license and KYC obligations.

Directly, SBF remarked,

“If you host a website that makes it easy for US retail to connect to and trade on a DEX, you would likely have to register as something like a broker-dealer.”

The crypto community is not on board with the requirement of licenses and KYC checks for DeFi, as Erik Voorhees from Bankless wrote in a recent blog post. CryptoSlate covered the response alongside Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy’s take on the situation. Fortune.com referred to the debate as “the battle for crypto’s soul” while describing SBF as “the most powerful man in crypto.”

The dispute spilled over onto Twitter on October 20 when SBF responded by remarking that “he did not feel heard” by Voorhees.

From your original post, it isn't clear where/how you draw the line. I think this is why so many have been upset about. ""Everyone should respect OFAC’s sanctions lists"" Everyone? Every American or all humans? Should a protocol developer from Japan be blocking all Iranians? — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) October 20, 2022

The outcome of the social media sparring match was the pair appearing on the Bankless YouTube channel during a livestream to discuss the issue face-to-face. The conversation is the first high-level public debate between two key industry personalities not to be beholden to 280 characters. As such, it could be viewed as an accurate representation of the significant aspects of the debate.

The conversation was extremely productive and addressed the root of much of the controversy. The following breakdown highlights the major aspects of the discussion and the crucial factors that affect the rest of us in the crypto industry.

SBF on crypto regulation

At the start of the Bankless livestream, SBF directly addressed whether crypto should be regulated. His response began by saying that “parts of it should be and parts of it shouldn’t.”

Several times SBF stipulated that “the details are in the nuances” of the debate. Speaking on nuance, SBF contended there to be two axes by which the community should address crypto regulation.

“How regulated crypto should be” “How thoughtful are we about which parts of it are regulated?”

SBF commented that it is the second axis he cares about the most, giving the example of stablecoins to support his argument. Many have questioned the legitimacy of Tether’s holdings over the years, and some form of oversight as to whether a stablecoin is fully backed is a necessity in SBF’s mind.

The FTX CEO went as far as to say that there should be “really thorough regulation confirming the number of dollars in the bank account is at least as many as the number of tokens.”

However, SBF argued that making a simple transaction in a store using a stablecoin should not require regulatory oversight through a “broker dealer,” a point he viewed as “very important.”

Labeling it as his “core thought,” SBF posited, “We should be really thoughtful about where the regulation comes in and what it does.” He believes that regulation is coming to crypto in the United States, and the debate should focus on which parts should be regulated, not whether they should be regulated at all.

SBF confirmed that he believes that “some of this regulation is definitively good… and it is not just a compromise.” Further, he reasoned that he is “cautiously optimistic” about any upcoming U.S. regulation on crypto.

“I’m optimistic that it will end up striking a balance where it will do a good job of providing a large ratio of customer protection to restriction of commerce.”

Erik Voorhees on crypto regulation

Erik Voorhees replied that requiring stablecoin providers to disclose their exact holdings would be a “higher bar than the Federal Reserve itself already applies.” Unlike the traditional banking system, the crypto industry already uses cryptographic proofs throughout its ecosystem.

“The crypto industry already have a higher standard of what constitutes knowledge, what constitutes proof and so it is a little ironic for people from the traditional financial world imposing on us the need to be proving anything.”

Voorhees contended that crypto is already “heavily regulated” and is subject to laws worldwide. He asserted that it would be his “panacea” for it not to be regulated but that this is not the case, referring to it as “encumbered.” Regulations are a significant factor in the state of traditional finance and the imbalance of the “status quo,” according to Voorhees.

Progressing his argument, Voorhees noted that the industry must ask itself if it wishes to move closer to the traditional world or to build something better. Voorhees believes that transparency within the current financial system is insufficient and asked, “why are we being burdened with additional requirements for transparency when we’re already more transparent.”

Regarding regulation at a high level, Voorhees took a strong stance stating that.

“The moral premises under which these regulations get imposed on us are important. They’re always cast down as if we have these morally prescient individuals in the government that know what’s right and wrong.”

This sentiment is one Voorhees wishes to challenge as the crypto industry is building “more virtuous financial systems than what exists today.”

The DeFi debate

SBF responded to Voorhees by agreeing that some of his posts may have included at least some “lazy choice of wording.” He agreed that DeFi is more transparent when it is entirely on chain but that companies like Celsius were much less regulated and transparent. SBF also clarified that by using the word ‘everyone,’ he meant ‘everyone in the U.S.’ and everyone around the world – a question raised in Voorhees’ original response.

SBF proclaimed,

“I would be excited to see bilateral engagement around ways that we can minimize the amount of collateral damage dealt while making sure to sanction terrorist activity.”

Voorhees level-headedly replied by requesting that OFAC sanctions related to crypto activity come with official “allegations” rather than a direct decree. OFAC sanctions do not require supporting evidence, and DeFi protocols may be required to censor addresses without knowing the exact reason why.

For example, rather than banning crypto use in North Korea, Voorhees argued for more crypto usage in the country to help its citizens break free of financial tyranny.

Voorhees summarized his position on how to engage with governments on crypto regulation by asserting that.

“My ask is that people like Sam who are engaging [with the government] be very careful about what they ask for and where they draw the lines.”

SBF’s opinion that crypto should “remain open and immutable” is one that Voorhees agreed on. However, SBF’s proposal that the front end of DeFi protocols like Aave should perhaps be regulated as a financial institution is where he drew the line.

The FTX CEO denied the assertion that he believes DeFi should be regulated in such a way, stipulating that “a lot of this is just permissionless code.” Therefore, SBF hopes that any U.S. regulations are a “light touch” on DeFi.

However, SBF sees the need for DeFi regulation when currently regulated financial entities like “Schwab” decide to offer DeFi products to its customers.

SBF confirmed that he thinks the most critical aspect of DeFi is that permissionless on-chain code, smart contracts, payments, and validators should be free of regulation, going as far as to call them “sacred.” He is willing to “compromise” on regulation to keep these things free of regulation by accepting regulation for front-end DeFi services. SBF then gave an example definition of an entity subject to regulation based on this compromise.

“A website hosted on a centralized service by an American that targets financial products at American retail back ending on to DeFi but is non-custodial.”

Voorhees responded to SBF’s suggestion by claiming that “the tendency of the regulators is to make the world a darker place no matter what” and that SBF is compromising too readily. His libertarian views appear at odds with SBF’s arguably pragmatic approach to regulation at a fundamental level.

Since the days of Satoshi, the crypto industry has focused solely on a financial system free of regulatory oversight by governments. Voorhees remains true to this vision in his rebuttals toward SBF. However, at this point, does the debate not reduce to a discussion on political grounds rather than objective profiteering? The crypto community is unsure.

Online perception of SBF

A clip of the discussion has been circulating on Twitter in which one Bitcoiner, Duo Nine, asserted, “This guy does not deserve what crypto has to offer. I’d be very careful about anything this guy touches.” The clip shows SBF failing to assert a reasonable rebuttal of Voorhees’s argument that censoring DeFi would be akin to censoring e-mail in the late 90s.

SBF stutters and fails to find the words to respond during the clip, and it ends with a comedy outro mimicking the Larry David show Curb your Enthusiasm. However, the podcast continued at this point, and SBF did find words to showcase that he understood Voorhees’ point of view, as stated earlier in this article.

Wait till the end. 👇#FTX CEO has lost the plot IMO. This guy does not deserve what crypto has to offer. I'd be very careful about anything this guy touches. He should not do interviews either. 😅 pic.twitter.com/a9zs0Jw8va — Duo Nine | YCC (@DU09BTC) October 29, 2022

A source familiar with the matter who asked to remain anonymous stated that the discourse around SBF has been “overblown” and is not in keeping with their experience of the FTX CEO. However, the source confirmed they had many trader friends who “dislike him and avoided trading on FTX as long as possible.”

During the livestream, SBF mirrored the above sentiment, claiming that others have been “misrepresenting pretty grossly what my position is, and I feel like I never said that” in response to a question on the need for compromise in the user interface of DeFi.

SBF confirmed that it is possible that the crypto industry may have to compromise on some aspects of regulation relating to the front end of DeFi protocols that interact with users inside the U.S. However, he also affirmed that he is “not saying thatwe should make happen… those I think would be probably not the right tactics.”

My take on the situation

From his conversation with Voorhees, it is hard to argue that SBF has malicious intent, as he continuously admitted to not knowing if he is correct and was firm that many aspects of crypto are “sacred.”

It is my view that SBF has made suggestions on compromises that could be made to keep on-chain transactions free of regulation that are now being taken as evidence he wants DeFi to be fully regulated.

Whether SBF’s public comments truly reflect his private actions remains to be seen. Yet, while I may not agree with everything SBF has said, I also do not agree with everything Voorhees expressed.

The issue is nuanced, and it is important to ensure an understanding of the opposing viewpoint before going on the attack. Regulation is coming to crypto, and the battlefield requires everyone in the crypto industry to engage in intelligent debate. Infighting will not lead to a revolution in the financial system, but considered civil discourse has a shot.

Thus, it appears that the jury is still out on SBF’s role in the crypto industry. Some view him as the savior following his bailouts of Voyager and BlockFi, some believe he has ulterior motives for personal gain, and others contest that he is simply misguided.

The topic of crypto regulation is unlikely to go away anytime soon. While SBF is involved in shaping U.S. legislation, the spotlight will remain firmly on him for the foreseeable future.

2022-10-31 09:43:37.060383,Bitcoinist,How ChainPort Is Making DeFi Cross-Chain Bridges Safer,"Hacks in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space have become so rampant that they are expected at this point. However, with billions of dollars passing through the industry, it has become imperative to ensure the safety of users through adequate security measures.

Bitcoinist caught up with Erez Ben-Kiki, CEO and Founder of DeFi cross-chain bridge, ChainPort, where he shares thoughts on the current DeFi climate and how ChainPort is ensuring the safety of user funds on its platform.

Bitcoinist: Hello Erez, let’s start by just giving us a brief background of your journey so far in crypto and DeFi

Erez Ben-Kiki: After graduating with a BA in economics, I worked for ten years in the financial sector as an analyst and Nostro manager, and trader. Later I transferred to digital advertising and founded a marketing agency. After falling deep into the crypto rabbit hole, I founded 2key, a project that later became DecentraLab.

Bitcoinist: So how did ChainPort come out of all of this?

Erez Ben-Kiki: Decentralab became a development house that builds various projects and products in the Web3 space. ChainPort is one of Dcentralab’s most prominent products, as well as Hord, TokensFarm, 2Key, and more coming soon.

TokensFarm is a leading Farm-As-A-Service provider; TokensFarm offers fully customized, deployable Vesting, LP, or staking farms that can be live within hours.

Hord is an innovative DeFi protocol that offers tokenized ETFs. Hord includes Viking DAO, Champion’s Pools, and more. Viking DAO is an investment platform where backers can support pools of up to 20 projects and receive a tradable pool token in return. Champions pools allow users to create or follow crypto trading strategies.

2key was the first project that brought Dcentralab together. 2Key offers multi-step link tracking and smart contracts over HTTP protocols via the noble 2key protocol.

ChainPort was born out of necessity. Interoperability is needed to connect different blockchains and facilitate communication and transfer of value between them. While interoperability and bridges are needed, it became evident that security is the “Achilles heel” for most bridges.

The issue is that bridges, like exchanges, are high-stakes platforms that hold enormous amounts of value and can be vulnerable to bugs in their underlying code. Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin mentioned the security risks of bridges on Reddit several months ago. Since then, hundreds of millions of dollars have been stolen in various bridge exploits and hacks.

We spent time trying to solve the security issue that many bridges have, and from this problem came ChainPort, the world’s first ultra-secure custodial bridge.

More than $55 billion are currently locked in DeFi protocols : Source: DefiLlama

Bitcoinist: ChainPort is a cross-chain bridge. Can you tell me how it’s different from other cross-chain bridges?

Erez Ben-Kiki: ChainPort is a cutting-edge cross-chain bridge that offers complete interoperability and custodian-level protection. ChainPort provides a level of security architecture that has never been seen before, reliably transferring tokens between blockchains with only a single click.ChainPort is the only custodial bridge in the world of blockchain. We store 95% of the funds in cold storage wallets provided by leading industry security experts, including FireBlocks MPC and Gnosis-safe multi-sig, to ensure the security of funds.

Users can port tokens in a permissionless manner with ChainPort, and human approval is not required. ChainPort is also a high-speed bridge; tokens can be ported in as fast as 2.5 minutes across chains. Users can also port tokens across multiple blockchains without the need to revert to the original token for each port.

Now, a lot of hacks have happened in DeFi, a good chunk of them being on cross-chain bridges. What are the most common risks with these kinds of DeFi protocols?

When it comes to risks regarding DeFi and specifically bridges, the most significant risk is smart contract risk.



In many recent bridge exploits, the core of the failure was “implicit checksums.” Implicit checksums mean the code relies on an implicit assumption that functions will be called or parameters will be used in a certain way.

Chainport has various checksums and monitoring tools in place to prevent failures. For example, we have a monitoring tool in place that constantly checks that the balance of assets across all our supported chains remains 1:1. Any deviation results in an immediate bridge freeze and can trigger potential rollbacks or manual intervention.



We also ensure all deposited funds are kept safe in cutting-edge multi-signature MPC wallets. So even in a worst-case scenario, funds have multiple layers of protection.

Bitcoinist: So what is ChainPort doing to make sure something like this never happens?



Erez Ben-Kiki: ChainPort brings a unique security architecture, funds segregation being the main one. Only up to 5% of the assets will be in the hot bridge contract, with the remaining 95% + being on rebalancing and treasury vaults. All our custodian wallets are secured by multiple security layers, including Fireblocks MPC and Gnosis multi-sig wallets, the main ones.



On top, ChainPort’s team rigorously tests all code and smart contracts, and they undergo multiple independent audits by blockchain security leaders. ChainPort passed numerous audits by both Certik & Cyber Unit. We’re also in the final stages of an audit with Trail of Bits, one of the top 3 auditors in the world.

We could fairly say that ChainPort today is the safest bridge in the crypto space.



Total DeFi market cap at $45.7 billion | Source: Crypto Total DeFi Market Cap on TradingView.com

Bitcoinist: Where does DeFi security go from here, do you think? Are DeFi protocols learning from these hacks to prevent future hacks?

Erez Ben-Kiki: Security is a constant game of cat and mouse. Learning as much as possible from every hack is necessary in the world of DeFi. Protocols need to emphasize security as much as possible.



It is almost impossible to be fully protected at all times, as hackers always outnumber you and your team. They will try day and night to hack and steal assets deposited in your product or protocol.



That’s why we took the custodial approach, which allows all parties to rest assured that even if it’s unlikely to happen, the funds are off-chain and fully protected.

These days, we introduce an even safer, more secure premium version of ChainPort, the ChainPort Private Custodian. The service combines ChainPort’s best features with added features and an enhanced custodial security model. The custodial security model shares the multi-sig keys with the project porting tokens and an external lawyer in a ⅗ multi-sig model.

Sharing multi-sig keys across three parties eliminate any single party’s access to the tokens and takes segregation one step forward. Distributing control makes the bridge even more secure and adds an extra layer of safety for tokens. Additional features include setting supported chains, a set path for ports, and setting the minimum or maximum amount of tokens you want to allow users to port are also part of that service.



Bitcoinist: To close, where do you see DeFi in the next five years? More interoperability or less?

Erez Ben-Kiki: Despite the recent market downturn, consumer interest in DeFi and cryptocurrency is still solid. According to Google Trends, the search volume for popular cryptocurrencies is much higher than in 2020. DeFi as an aspect of crypto will continue to grow, with even more novel protocols and chains being developed. As such, interoperability will be necessary, and bridges will be required to facilitate the transfer of information and value. Crypto adoption is most probably here to stay and thrive. Interoperability will be a significant part of the next cycle of growth.



At ChainPort, we’re constantly adding support for more tokens and blockchains to guarantee more interoperability. Just recently, we’ve added support for Fantom and Dogechain. Support for Cardano, Arbitrum, Milkomeda, Solana, and many other chains is also coming soon to ChainPort. With bridges like ChainPort, it is safe to say that we will see much greater interoperability in the next few years.

2022-10-31 09:43:37.082750,Bloomberg Law,,"By the time he arrived in London in January, Kyle Roche was on a roll.

Weeks earlier, his firm had scored a $100 million judgment against a self-proclaimed Bitcoin inventor, another step to break from the pack of attorneys trying to make their mark in cryptocurrency law.

Roche had also landed as a client the blockchain startup Ava Labs, paying him and his partners in digitized tokens worth millions.

Now, barely five years out of law school, the young lawyer had come to woo potential investors for a startup venture he said he was working on with Ava Labs. In one restaurant meeting, with the alcohol flowing, the lawyer touted himself as a “crazy motherf—er” when it came to court battles. He also boasted about a bold litigation strategy on behalf of Ava Labs—using investor class-action suits to weigh down their competitors.

In another private gathering that day, he crowed: “Because I sue half the companies in this space, I know where this market is going.”

What he didn’t know: His comments were being recorded.

Those conversations, including one in which Roche boasted his job included giving US regulators other “magnets” to go after, became the fuse that ignited a spectacularly swift downfall for an apparent fast-rising star in the niche field. Since videos of them were anonymously posted online in August, Roche has lost his role as a lead attorney in potentially law-defining cases, exited the firm he founded and retreated from public view.

How it happened offers a window into what can be the cutthroat nature of a fledgling trillion-dollar industry, one whose volatility has engendered a flood of lawsuits, courtroom skirmishes, and, in this case, an apparent elaborate scheme to take down a lawyer.

It’s still unclear who was behind the secret recordings or behind Crypto Leaks, the website that posted them. Roche and his former firm, in statements online and in court, have denied wrongdoing and claimed the videos were selectively edited to erase important context.

They have asserted the hidden-camera ambush was orchestrated by representatives for a Swiss blockchain firm they had sued just months before the London meetings, though they’ve not offered evidence to substantiate it.

Roche declined to comment to Bloomberg Law. But much of the story has emerged through legal proceedings, court filings, public statements and interviews, including with the prominent Norwegian investor at the center of it all.



The Crypto Lawyer

Roche’s interest in crypto took off during his first year at the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law in 2013, when he became fascinated by the legal systems surrounding currency. As a student, he collaborated with one professor on a paper touting the long-term advantages of the decentralized digital asset Bitcoin.

After graduating in 2016, he landed at the Armonk, N.Y., office of Boies Schiller Flexner, the vaunted Big Law firm, and began representing clients in crypto-related disputes.

Roche speaking at an event in 2017.

Three years later, he co-founded his own firm, one eventually filled with ex-Boies lawyers specializing in fast-developing areas like crypto. One early client, Ava Labs, even agreed to pay them with its fledgling AVAX digital tokens, which had not yet entered the market. Roche also got an equity stake in the company.

Roche and his co-founder, Devin “Velvel” Freedman, had for months worked on novel legal theories they’d argue under their new banner. Their first suit, filed in October 2019, accused the crypto exchange Bitfinex and its affiliate Tether, the company behind the Tether stablecoin, of a multibillion-dollar price manipulation scheme.

The firm later teamed with New York boutique Selendy Gay Elsberg to file 11 suits against crypto exchanges and token issuers for the alleged sale of unregistered securities.

Meanwhile, their Ava Labs bet paid massive dividends. After being introduced in 2020, the value of AVAX tokens owned collectively by Roche Freedman lawyers once reached $250 million, according to claims one partner later made in federal court.

Roche and Freedman also found the spotlight representing a client suing Craig Wright, who has claimed to be the person who developed Bitcoin. The estate of Wright’s alleged former business partner claimed it was entitled to half a cache of Bitcoin they mined together in the asset’s early years.

A federal jury in Florida cleared Wright in December 2021 of claims including fraud and theft, but ordered him to pay a $100 million judgment for the unlawful seizure of intellectual property.

Roche Freedman touted the judgment as precedent-setting. Roche would later cite the verdict to support his litigation bona fides.

“The litigation with Craig Wright put them on the map,” said Stephen D. Palley, a lawyer who has written on legal topics relating to crypto.

Weeks after that case, however, Roche took the trip that would change his fortunes.

Looking for Partners

He arrived in London hoping to line up investors for a litigation crowdfunding startup he wanted to develop with Ava Labs. Named Ryval, the venture was intended to allow people to place bets on litigation on Ava’s Avalanche platform.

On a Thursday afternoon, Roche traveled to a three-story townhouse in the city’s upscale Mayfair section that served as the office of Christen Ager-Hanssen, a high-profile venture capitalist who has reportedly made and lost millions in tech and media deals. Ager-Hanssen covered the first-class airfare and hotel costs for Roche and his fiancee, Roche would later say in a declaration submitted in court.

The meeting was arranged by an independent business consultant living in London, Ager-Hanssen said in an interview and a written statement to Bloomberg Law. The Norwegian businessman said he had never before met the consultant, who identified himself as Mauricio Andres Villavicencio de Aguilar. According to emails shared with Bloomberg Law, the consultant had first contacted Ager-Hanssen in November 2021 about coordinating a potential investment opportunity in the blockchain arena.

Ager-Hanssen said he quizzed Roche at his office for a couple hours about Ava Labs and the proposed startup. He said he did not record the meeting, or know who did, but that the video excerpts later released were from the consultant’s vantage at the table. He also said he did not go with Roche to the restaurant that night, but that the consultant did.

Christen Ager-Hanssen

Ager-Hanssen said he was intrigued by the Ryval concept, and flew to New York weeks later to continue talking with Roche and Ava Labs executives. By March, however, his interest had waned and he opted not to invest.

The startup plans lagged in the ensuing months. Roche still stayed busy, splitting his time between New York and Miami as his firm grew to more than 20 lawyers and became more active in the class-action sphere when the digital asset market plummeted.

The crash stoked a lot of scrutiny. Amid the fallout, an anonymous website emerged, promising to root out bad actors.

‘Evil Conspiracy’

Crypto Leaks announced itself in June with a website, a Twitter account, and pledges to expose corruption in the fledgling industry.

“Follow us to find out what vested interests don’t want you to know,” it said in its inaugural tweet. But Crypto Leaks hid behind its own curtain: Its domain was anonymously registered that May.

Its first two posts focused on what it called “attacks” on the Internet Computer blockchain and the once-buzzy ICP token introduced by the Dfinity Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit led by Dominic Wiliams. The digital asset quickly plummeted in value after being sold to retail investors in May 2021.

Neither of the website’s first posts got traction. Then, on Aug. 26, Crypto Leaks released its third so-called “case study.”

“Ava Labs (Avalanche) attacks Solana and cons SEC in evil conspiracy with bought law firm, Roche Freedman” blared the headline.

The post claimed to reveal “an extraordinary secret pact” between Roche Freedman and Ava Labs “that harms the crypto industry.” It described Roche as a lawyer who used the legal system “gangster style” to attack Ava Labs’ competitors, and pursue “personal vendettas” for the blockchain company’s leader.

Weaved into the text were 25 video clips of Roche speaking in two settings: at the conference table in the Mayfair office that January afternoon and in the bustling restaurant he visited later that night, in front of a plate of food and a wine goblet.

Excerpts from both showed Roche explaining his close ties to Ava Labs and his win-or-go-home approach to litigation, and at times disparaging the legal system. In one clip, he reveled in “the fact that 10 idiots control the flow of all the money that happens in American class actions.”

The Fallout

The recordings’ release sparked a quick disavowal from Ava Labs’ CEO and statements from leaders across the crypto space—both about what Roche said and whoever recorded it.

“Who’s funding all these hit pieces?” tweeted Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges.

Roche quickly denied deploying litigation as a weapon to go after Ava Labs’ competitors and vowed to fight efforts to intimidate him and his firm. But the blowback was intense. In court filings, his firm said he had received “threats of violence” in the days after the recordings were released.

Roche

Within days, Roche’s partners announced he was barred from participating in any ongoing class action. They called the move an attempt to protect the firm against appearances of impropriety.

That didn’t stifle Roche’s detractors. Lawyers for Bitfinex and Tether, defendants in a class-action suit brought by Roche Freedman, called for the entire firm to be disqualified, claiming the videos raised “grave concerns” about their motivations.

At least four defendants in other cases, including Dfinity, also brought disqualification motions against the law firm, citing Roche’s London comments as a conflict of interest.

At least one of Roche’s clients dropped him. One partner left the firm.

Ava Labs also sought to distance itself. CEO Emin Gun Sirer called the allegations of targeting competitors through litigation “conspiracy theory nonsense” and said Roche made false statements about his work for the company. By mid-September, he publicly declared that Roche no longer represented Ava Labs and that he’d relinquished his shares in the company.

The next month, Roche’s partners fought to keep the firm’s role as lead counsel in the class action against Bitfinex and Tether—a case they had been litigating for three years. They argued they were victims of a scheme by another defendant in a separate case to cripple the firm’s cryptocurrency practice.

New York Judge Katherine Polk Failla was unpersuaded, concluding that Roche’s “uniquely stupid” comments were “too detailed to dismiss” as just being “drunk and stupid.” She said she recognizes the difference between Roche and his partners, but said, “at this point in time, I have concerns about the firm as well.”

Roche, meanwhile, tried to identify his saboteur.

He publicly claimed that Ager-Hanssen had been working for Williams, the Dfinity leader. He offered no evidence to back up the claim, but in a post on the website Medium, Roche cited a 2017 article in The Telegraph, a U.K.-based newspaper, that noted Ager-Hanssen helps “eccentric billionaires” facing legal issues and that he has a history of covert recordings.

Last week, Roche’s former partners asserted in a court filing that Ager-Hanssen is a “‘conflict management’ specialist” who was hired by Dfinity to spy on Roche. The filing was made in the firm’s ongoing class action against Dfinity for alleged securities fraud and market manipulation.

“The publicly available evidence establishes” Dfinity is behind the Crypt Leaks site, the firm added, noting that on the same day the Crypto Leaks domain was registered, Dfinity’s CEO had tweeted he was “coming for’’ those who attacked the ICP token.

Neither Dfinity nor its outside counsel responded to repeated requests for comment from Bloomberg Law.

In a phone interview, Ager-Hanssen denied Roche’s accusation, claiming he’s never met Williams and that he did not know about the surreptitious recordings. He said he suspected they were arranged by the consultant. He said he has not spoken to the man since the meetings —and can’t be sure Villavicencio de Aguilar wasn’t an alias.

Still, Ager-Hanssen hasn’t shied from the attention, celebrating Roche’s downfall. “Kyle Roche dragged me into this by lying about facts,” he tweeted on Aug. 30, a day after Roche accused him of being behind the recordings.

Bloomberg Law has been unable to reach the consultant or confirm his name and occupation. Emails sent to an address he used with Ager-Hanssen and others were not returned.

The disclosure of the recordings could be in violation of privacy laws in Britain, including the 2018 Data Protection Act.

Two weeks ago, Roche’s partners severed ties with him and moved to rename the firm Freedman Normand Friedland LLP.

“We are focused on continuing to provide our clients with top quality representation and are proud of the firm’s accomplishments to date,” a spokeswoman said in their only public comment. “We wish Kyle the best in his future endeavors.”

Out On His Own

Roche has since established his own practice, Kyle Roche P.A., according to an Oct. 20 court filing. He continues to represent clients in some individual matters.

Like his ex-colleagues, Roche is vying to remain counsel in the case against Wright, which is now on appeal. Wright, too, has moved to disqualify Roche and his former firm.

It’s unclear if Roche or his former firm are taking more steps to bolster their claims that people from Dfinity were behind the recordings. But details are likely to emerge in the coming weeks; a California judge has scheduled a Jan. 12 hearing on Dfinity’s motion to disqualify the law firm from its class action case.

By then, nearly a year will have passed since the fateful trip that changed Roche’s path.

“You can have 15 minutes of fame and you can have 15 minutes of infamy,” said Jan Jacobowitz, a University of Miami law professor and legal ethics adviser. “He may have loyal clients that are going to stay with him. It’s always hard to measure how long public sentiment will last.”",,3 hours ago,"['labs', 'roches', 'ava', 'litigation', 'crypto', 'agerhanssen', 'firm', 'roche', 'legal', 'law']"
2022-10-31 08:43:37.398180,Dignited,Here Are 20 Web 3 Terms You Should Learn Today,"Web 3 is speculated to be the new Internet and we have an article already covering the subject matter. All we know it is still a nascent technology with a lot of attention even from the world’s richest. Let’s get into the Web 3.0 jargon in this article and try to understand what exactly is happening behind building the world’s new web of decentralization and mostly used words and their meanings.

When I was still new to the web 3 community, I would hear or come across a new word or term almost every other day until I decided to embrace it and become a lifelong learner. If you are also new to this space, I would recommend you to learn as much as you can sometimes things may not make sense at first but trust me they will. Learn Blockchain basics from another article we wrote here.

So here are the 20 Web 3.0 terms and jargon you should learn today and in no particular order: We have looked at some of the terms in our previous posts in case you don’t see some here like DAO, NFTs, SBTs, etc.

🔹 51% Attack

If more than half the computer power or mining hash rate on a network is run by a single person or a single group of people, then a 51% attack is in operation.

🔹 Block Size

In blockchain technology, block size refers to the amount of data about transactions a single block in the chain can carry. Basically, a 51% attack happens when a malicious user in a network acquires control of a given blockchain’s mining capabilities.

🔹 GM

The acronym “GM” typically stands for “Good Morning.” GM Wagmi is a project that takes inspiration from this greeting, having created a whole new token to spread positivity and make the crypto space a better place.

🔹 Cold Storage

Offline storage of cryptocurrencies, typically involving hardware non-custodial wallets, USBs, offline computers, or paper wallets.

🔹 Dead Cat Bounce

A dead cat bounce is a short-term recovery in a declining trend that does not indicate a reversal of the downward trend. Reasons for a dead cat bounce include a clearing of short positions, investors believing the bottom has been reached, or investors that find oversold assets.

🔹 Testnet

As the name suggests, a testnet is a separate blockchain where developers can put new features through their paces without worrying about jeopardizing the main network.

🔹 HODL

A type of passive investment strategy where you hold an investment for a long period of time, regardless of any changes in the price or markets.

The term first became famous due to a typo made in a Bitcoin forum, and the term is now commonly expanded to stand for “Hold On for Dear Life.”

🔹 dApps

Dapps are decentralized applications that live on the blockchain. … Several platforms are available to deploy dApps on, including Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche, etc.

🔹 Mainnet

There are many types of networks in blockchain like testnet, request, signets, etc. Unlike the other networks, which are used for testing purposes, mainnet coins have a monetary value. When people refer to the Bitcoin network, they are usually referring to mainnet.

🔹 Liquidity Mining

Liquidity mining is a mechanism or process in which participants supply cryptocurrencies into liquidity pools, and are rewarded with fees and tokens based on their share of the total pool liquidity.

🔹 Dumping

A collective market sell-off occurs when large quantities of a particular cryptocurrency are sold in a short period of time.

🔹 Dusting Attack

An attack that aims to uncover the identity of a wallet’s owner, information that can subsequently be used in phishing scams.

ERC-20 tokens are based on the Ethereum blockchain. Just like mainstream cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, they can be used to make purchases — or traded for fiat currencies and crypto.

🔹 Faucet

A cryptocurrency reward system usually on a website or app, rewards users for completing certain tasks. The basic definition of crypto faucets paints them as websites, applications, or platforms that help users earn free crypto rewards.

🔹 Gas

A term used on the Ethereum platform refers to a unit measuring the computational effort of conducting transactions or smart contracts or launching DApps in the Ethereum network. It is the “fuel” of the Ethereum network. *see Gas Limit and Gas Price.

🔹 Hard Fork

A hard fork as it relates to blockchain technology is a radical change to a network’s protocol that makes previously invalid blocks and transactions valid, or vice-versa. There is also a soft one; look it up!

2022-10-31 12:43:37.400302,TechStory,The Top 5 NFT Marketplaces Surpass $40 Billion in All-Time Sales,"While non-fungible token (NFT) deals have slipped starting from the beginning of the year, the main five commercial centers, regarding the biggest number ever deals, have arrived at more than $40 billion. Additionally, the NFT commercial center stage Opensea caught more than $32 billion worth of deals as the NFT market stage as of now overwhelms the main five NFT commercial centers by 79%.

During the period of October, the main five NFT commercial centers outperformed the $40 billion imprint, concerning all-time deals, with around $41.36 billion on Oct. 29, 2022. The biggest NFT commercial center as far as deals was Opensea as it approaches the $33 billion territory with $32.76 billion recorded on Saturday.

Measurements from dappradar.com shows that the $32.76 billion in deals were executed by $2.34 million merchants. On Saturday, Oct. 29, the normal cost paid for a NFT by means of Opensea is around $352.

Opensea is trailed by the Axie Commercial center ($4.26B), Wizardry Eden ($1.83B), Looksrare ($1.62B), and X2Y2 ($891M). Axie Commercial center watches out for NFTs that originate from the play-to-acquire (P2E) blockchain game Axie Limitlessness and the market has seen 2.17 million brokers to date.

The typical cost paid for a NFT by means of Axie Commercial center is around $171. Solana’s Enchanted Eden has caught $1.83 billion in deals that were settled by 1.21 million brokers. The typical worth paid for a NFT on Sorcery Eden on Oct. 29 is $124.

The NFT commercial center Looksrare has seen less merchants, as records show 107,636 settled exchanges by means of the Looksrare market. Be that as it may, the typical cost paid for a NFT on Saturday is far bigger as the normal NFT deal is $6.59K on Looksrare.

X2Y2 has not tapped a billion in NFT deals yet, however it has been creeping its direction toward that achievement. On Oct. 29, 2022, the NFT market X2Y2 settled $891 million among 158,273 brokers. The typical cost paid for a NFT on X2Y2 is roughly $582.78 at the hour of composing.

Other driving NFT commercial centers as far as all-time deals incorporate Mobox ($694M), Solanart ($665M), Bloctobay ($458M), Atomicmarket ($435M), Permanent X Commercial center ($337M), and Rarible ($300M) individually. In spite of being down an extraordinary arrangement in month to month deals, more than $40 billion in lifetime deals among the main five business sectors is truly an accomplishment.

Information from cryptoslam.io shows that NFT deals across the globe during the most recent 30 days amounted to $426 million, which is down 21.32% from the month earlier. The most recent 30 days saw around 4,556,057 NFT exchanges among 510,859 NFT purchasers.","Additionally, the NFT commercial center stage Opensea caught more than $32 billion worth of deals as the NFT market stage as of now overwhelms the main five NFT commercial centers by 79%.

2022-10-31 11:43:37.402340,Decrypt,Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin: Crypto Industry Shouldn't Be 'Enthusiastically Pursuing Institutional Capital',"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin weighed in Sunday on the regulatory debate surrounding crypto, providing his thoughts on what industry rules should—and should not—include.

Regulation could make crypto more palatable to mainstream financial institutions and legitimize cryptocurrencies as an asset class. But new rules and policies could also alter the industry’s DNA, particularly as it relates to principles like censorship resistance and decentralization.

Buterin said he believes preserving the latter should be the priority.

“I don't think we should be enthusiastically pursuing large institutional capital at full speed,” he said. “Regulation that leaves the crypto space free to act internally but makes it harder for crypto projects to reach the mainstream is much less bad than regulation that intrudes on how crypto works internally.”

Basically, especially at this time, regulation that leaves the crypto space free to act internally but makes it harder for crypto projects to reach the mainstream is much less bad than regulation that intrudes on how crypto works internally. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 30, 2022

Buterin’s Twitter thread comes ten days after a controversial blog post by Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and chief executive of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, in which he outlined his regulatory vision for the industry.

Bankman-Fried subsequently capitulated to Crypto Twitter after receiving pushback on potential rules related to DeFi, such as requiring autonomous programs to comply with U.S. sanctions and making crypto websites register as a broker-dealer. He revised the post and said he will continue to do so.

Regulatory uncertainty is seen as a barrier to institutional crypto investing, according to a new Fidelity Investments survey. The Institutional Investor Digital Assets Study found that out of more than 1,000 institutional investors, 16% said a lack of clarity around regulation was an obstacle to investing in digital assets.

On the other hand, more than 8 in 10 (81%) of the institutional investors surveyed view digital assets as having a role in investment portfolios. In addition, 43% of institutional investors said they would be interested in a Bitcoin ETF.

Segments of the crypto industry have been pursuing institutional capital for almost a decade, ever since the Winklevoss twins’ initial filing for a Bitcoin ETF-like trust in 2013. While futures-based products trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Securities and Exchange Commission has dragged its feet on approving a spot-based Bitcoin ETF.

That’s not a bad thing, according to Buterin.

“I'm actually kinda happy a lot of the ETFs are getting delayed,” he said. “The ecosystem needs time to mature before we get even more attention.”

Another maybe-controversial take of mine is that I don't think we should be enthusiastically pursuing large institutional capital at full speed. I'm actually kinda happy a lot of the ETFs are getting delayed. The ecosystem needs time to mature before we get even more attention. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 30, 2022

Buterin divided the policy goals he envisions for the crypto industry into two categories: providing better protection to consumers who navigate the nascent industry, and stemming the illicit flow of cryptocurrency—which he said are not exclusive to the DeFi space.

To address the latter, Buterin is skeptical of requiring DeFi protocol front-ends to abide by Know Your Customer (KYC) standards. While such standards are used by financial institutions to prevent money laundering, fraud, and corruption, “hackers write custom code to interact with contracts,” circumventing the usual KYC barriers.

“It would annoy users but do nothing against hackers,” he said.

The ""KYC on defi frontends"" idea does not seem very pointful to me: it would annoy users but do nothing against hackers. Hackers write custom code to interact with contracts already. Exchanges are clearly a much more sensible place to do the KYC, and that's happening already. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 30, 2022

There are DeFi regulations that Buterin thinks could be more helpful, such as limits on the amount of leverage a user can trade with, transparency in code audits, and requiring “knowledge-based tests” as opposed to “plutocratic net-worth minimum rules.”

Buterin said he’s also in favor of crafting regulation in a way that allows for the further use of zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic principle that preserves privacy.

The response to the response

SBF responded to Buterin’s points, stating he thinks they “are pretty reasonable” and expressed an openness to bringing the ethereum co-founder to Washington DC in order to give nuanced input on regulation.

“I think that policymakers/regulators would find it pretty interesting to hear from @VitalikButerin,” SBF stated. “he's very different from the average person in DC, but in a kinda refreshing way—calmly and thoughtfully saying what he thinks.”

Buterin’s comments also appeared to receive an endorsement from Changpeng Zhao, founder and chief executive of Binance, another leading cryptocurrency exchange. The CEO responded to the thread with a thumbs up emoji.

Crypto investor Ryan Sean Adams gave a nod to Buterin’s entry into the debate as well, stating Buterin is welcome to share his thoughts at Bankless, a DAO and crypto media project.

Adams had delivered pointed criticism to SBF’s initial blog post, tweeting, “This absolutely sucks.”

For instance, Hedera’s volume exhibited a lot of volatility over the past seven days. Furthermore, its overall volume reduced by 66% in the past week. Its market cap dominance continued to decline as well and fell by 7.36% during the same time period. At press time, Hedera had captured 0.16% of the overall crypto market.

However, despite the decline in volume and market cap, its volatility was low and had reduced by 40% over the last month. This would indicate that it would be less riskier for investors to buy HBAR at the time of writing.

However, despite HBAR’s drawbacks in these areas, the Hedera network was able to perform well in the DeFi space. As can be seen from the image below, Hedera’s TVL showed impressive growth over the past few weeks.

At the time of writing, Hedera’s TVL was at $19.83 million and had appreciated by 3.06% in the last 24 hours.

Despite the positive developments of Hedera in the DeFi space, it couldn’t perform well in the dApp area. Furthermore, according to data from DappRadar, top performing dApps on the Hedera network, such as SaucerSwap and HeliSwap did not witness a positive week.

SaucerSwap’s unique active users depreciated by 3.21% and during the same time HeliSwap’s unique active users depreciated by 14.97%. However, the decline in dApp interest did not slow down the growth of HBAR’s prices. At the time of writing HBAR’s prices appreciated by 3.03% in the last 24 hours.

Its volume appreciated by 40% in the same time period as well. Developments such as the Hedera network’s Halloween event could also have been one of the reasons for HBAR’s recent uptick.

2022-10-31 11:43:37.406114,Business Post Nigeria,"Sustainable Finance Will Attract Growth, Development—SEC","By Aduragbemi Omiyale

As a country with abundant natural and human resources, Nigeria has been identified as better positioned to embrace sustainable finance principles and attract investment for the continent’s much-needed growth and development.

This was stated by the Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Mr Lamido Yuguda, during a lecture to mark the commemoration of the IOSCO World Investor Week with the theme Investor Resilience and Sustainable Finance, held Friday in Abuja.

The IOSCO World Investor Week is an annual event coordinated by IOSCO, which encourages its members, and securities regulators around the world to commemorate their respective jurisdictions to promote investor education and protection.

Mr Yuguda, represented by the SEC’s Executive Commissioner Operations, Mr Dayo Obisan, stated that the theme for this year’s WIW, ‘Investor Resilience’ and ‘Sustainable Finance’, demonstrates the high-value IOSCO places on investor protection and the environment, especially in the context of the global pandemic and other challenges such as inflationary pressures, uncertainties occasioned by geopolitical tensions, and continued environmental degradation.

According to him, “Indeed, the themes, undoubtedly, further place emphasis on the universal call for sustainable finance and its resultant economic growth and development. There is no doubt, therefore, that all jurisdictions must think of transiting from exploiting nature to restoring nature.

“It is worthy of note that SEC through the market development department, has done well to outline robust activities for the week-long global events.”

The SEC boss said sustainable finance has evolved as a global concept, and the world firmly stands together to promote the transition to a low-carbon, more resource-efficient economy towards building a financial system that incentivises sustainable growth across nations.

“World over, issuers and investors are embracing the idea of sustainable investing and environment-friendly projects, hence the significant surge in sustainable investment within the last few years, which is apparently driven mainly by investors’ desire for a cleaner, healthier and more equitable future.

“The commission, as a regulator, is very much aware of its critical role in ensuring that the financial sector is steered towards green investments through its policies and regulations.

The DG said it is in early recognition of the importance of sustainable finance, the commission came up with Rules on Green Bonds in 2018, and already three approvals were granted to some corporate Issuers. The organisation also issued Rules on Social Bonds in 2021.

In his remarks, Director Market Development Department, Mr Nestor Ikeagu, said the IOSCO WIW is an annual global week-long event aiming to promote investor education and protection and strengthen collaborations among member jurisdictions.

To commemorate the IOSCO WIW 2022, the Commission embarked on activities, such as enlightenment outreaches, social media campaigns and radio appearances, to mention a few.

Topics covered during the week presented participants with opportunities to discuss and reflect on what boosts and enhances investor resilience in the market, as well as sustainable finance as it involves making investment decisions that consider not only financial returns but also environmental, social, and governance factors.

2022-10-31 09:43:37.417053,Coindoo,Best Coins to Stake and How to Get Started,"Lately, PoS has been in the crypto world’s public eye more than anything else. And as the trend tends to lean toward staking, we can’t help but look for the best coins to stake.

For blockchain environments, the algorithm securing the network can be a deal maker or a deal breaker. That’s because it shows the earning potential users may have, as well as how secure and performant a network can be.

It’s hard to decide which are the best coins to stake, though. The information is quite dispersed, and the subject looks a little intimidating.

But, if Elon Musk could launch his spaceship out there, you surely can get started with staking. Plus, staking cryptocurrency is nowhere near as complicated as rocket science.

So, let’s see how you can start staking.

What Is Staking in Simpler Words?

The definition and terminology might vary from project to project. Yet, generally speaking, staking is the process within the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism that involves the appointment of a node to validate the next block. Hence, the chosen nodes are called validators.

To become a validator, a node has to deposit a certain number of coins into the network as a stake. In a way, it is similar to a security deposit.

The size of the stake affects a node’s chance to validate the next block. The bigger the stake, the more chances someone has to be chosen as a validator.

Once chosen, the validator checks if the transactions are valid. If there are no issues, the new block is added to the blockchain. Afterward, the validator receives the fees associated with the transactions.

When a node wants to stop being a validator, the staker can simply pull out the coins together with the transaction fees.

What If some Lousy Party Decides to Mess with the Validation Process?

Well, PoS investors thought about that, too.

If a validator does not do their job correctly, they will lose a part of his stake or even all of it.

So, validators can lose a lot more money than they can gain if they misbehave.

Moreover, users can’t unlock their stake straight away as the network first needs to check if a validator should be punished.

Yet, although it seems to be a more efficient and eco-friendly system than Proof of Work, Proof of Stake is a less proven method, and there are quite a few concerns with it. One of them is that the whales are at an obvious advantage.

So, different cryptocurrency networks came up with additional protocols and variations of the PoS.

The coin age selection and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) are some of the most known.

In coin age selection, the number of coins being staked is multiplied by the length of time they have been held for. After validating a block, the coin age is reset to zero, and the validator has to wait a certain period before he can be chosen again.

The DPoS system is maintained through an election process that mainly requires holders to vote for delegates. Delegates are responsible for validating new blocks.

The number of delegates may vary from one network to another. Some networks have a fixed number of delegates that can range between 21 and 101, while others may have an indefinite number.

Each cryptocurrency holder in the network gets several votes that they can use themselves or delegate their stake to another stakeholder on the network to vote on their behalf.

As blocks are produced every few seconds, delegates that attempt to mess with the blockchain’s integrity or fail to constantly make blocks will lose reputation and be expelled and replaced by another delegate.

Top Proof of Stake Coins

Ethereum (ETH)

Ethereum is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market, and it switched from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS). The change is called The Merge, and it helped Ethereum become a promising option for staking.

Simply put, Ethereum is a decentralized software platform basing its activity on blockchain technology. It supports smart contracts, which are essential for decentralized applications to function well.

The Ethereum blockchain is widely used by developers for creating technology based upon it, and it is used in a wide range of industries. Furthermore, crypto investors can receive ETH for completing actions to support the blockchain, and they can pay for some goods and services where crypto payments are accepted.

Ethereum staking rewards change based on how much of the cryptocurrency is staked. Thus, the more ETH is staked, the lower the rewards will be. After The Merge, validators can get an APY (Annual Percentage Yield) of 5%. 3

Thus, if you stake $1000 worth of ETH, you will get a yearly reward of around $50.

CARDANO (ADA)

The second of the best coins to stake in our list is Cardano. In Cardano, staking involves a proof-of-stake algorithm known as Ouroboros. It divides up time into “epochs” that contain 21,600 slots. Slots are short periods in which a block can be created, and they last around 20 seconds.

These epochs are each led by elected slot leaders who are responsible for creating and confirming blocks. The transactions in the blocks created by slot leaders are then approved by input endorsers, chosen based on stakes. There can be more than one input endorser in each epoch.

The rewards given for participating in the Cardano blockchain are split between three stakeholders: input endorsers, multiparty computation stakeholders, and slot leaders.

Through the Shelly incentivized testnet, Cardano allows non-custodial delegation to pools as well as staking pool creation. And as it seems, staking Cardano comes with a 5% average early return. (More details here)

So, for an ADA equivalent of $1,000, you may get a yearly reward of around $50.

Avalanche (AVAX)

Avalanche is a blockchain platform that can process around 4,500 transactions per second (tps), which is significantly more than Ethereum, which stands at around 14 tps. Its native cryptocurrency is called AVAX, and it was launched in 2020.

Avalanche was developed to be a fast, secure, affordable, and accessible open-source project, and it also has a smart contract platform.

AVAX was built to pay transaction processing fees, secure the network, and act as a basic unit of account among Avalanche-based blockchains.

In the Avalanche staking process, there are two types of participants: validators and delegators. While validators secure Avalanche, process transactions, and create new blocks, delegators are those who hold tokens and want to participate in staking but choose to do that through an existing validating node. The process is called “delegation.”

The yearly staking rewards for delegators and validators are quite close, standing at 8.67% and 8.97%, respectively.

So, if you want to stake AVAX as a delegator, you will have a yearly reward of $86.7 for $1000 worth of AVAX staked. On the other hand, if you stake the same amount as a validator, your yearly staking reward will be $89.7.

Solana (SOL)

Solana is a blockchain platform launched in 2017. Its main purpose is to host decentralized, scalable applications. The Solana blockchain can process around 4,000 transactions per second, a great number when compared to Ethereum’s TPS.

Solana’s token (SOL) has a market cap of more than $10 billion (at the time of writing), and it is used for staking and paying fees associated with smart contracts and other transactions. SOL has an APY of around 6%, meaning that for $1000 worth of Solana staked, you will get a yearly reward of approximately $60.

Polkadot (DOT)

Polkadot was founded by Dr. Gavin Wood, Robert Habermeier, and Peter Czaban within the Web3 Foundation.

The goal is to build an ecosystem where different projects can build their projects upon and rely on its security instead of building from the ground up.

The network connects blockchains through a system involving a Relay chain, several shards called parachains, and bridges.

As for the governance system, Polkadot employs a referendum-like method called Referenda. The voting system aims to engage a large part of the community by granting DOT holders voting rights based on their stake.

To become a voter, a DOT holder must lock their coins up for at least the enactment delay period beyond the end of the referendum. There is also the possibility to vote without locking, but the vote’s value is drastically reduced.

Polkadot’s consensus system has a staking consensus protocol at the base. But besides becoming a validator with a 24/7 active node, the staking also engages a system of nominators.

The validators are there to validate transactions, and the nominators are there to nominate a validator.

The nominator can attribute his stake to up to 16 validators he trusts and will earn rewards based on their activities.

Polkadot has one of the highest annualized total reward rates, around 14%.

Thus, if you stake $1,000 in DOT, you can earn up to $140 a year, making it the best coin to stake from our list.

Polygon (MATIC)

Polygon is a platform designed to allow blockchain networks to connect and scale. It was launched in 2017 and operates on the Ethereum blockchain, connecting other Ethereum-based projects. Unlike other Proof-of-Stake projects, Polygon uses a modified PoS mechanism which allows a consensus to be achieved with every block. Validators who successfully complete a network transaction are rewarded with MATIC, Polygon’s native token.

MATIC is an ERC-20 token used to secure and govern the Polygon network, as well as paying transaction fees.

Currently, the yearly staking return for Polygon stands at around 7%, which means that if you stake $1,000 worth of MATIC, you will get a yearly reward of approximately $70. How to Start Staking Cryptocurrency

Open up a Node

Opening up a node can be a double-edged sword. It can be profitable, or it can be a massive waste of time with money locked up.

In most cases, it requires you to set up a dedicated application and lock up some cryptocurrency. However, if you want to set up a node for one of the proof-of-stake coins, consider the structure of their incentivizing layer.

If nodes are based solely on the stake’s size, your chances of actually getting to create a block are very low. So, a coin age mechanism that prevents the same users from creating blocks consecutively will improve your chances.

Additionally, in systems where you have to be elected and delegated by other users, branding and marketing your node to build credibility will be essential.

Third Parties such as Wallets and Exchanges

Setting up a node can involve a lot more effort than you would think, and there may even be a money barrier even in the case of the best coins to stake. Even for Ethereum 2.0, it was announced that you could start staking for Ether on a regular laptop, but only if you can stake at least 32 ETH.

A more accessible alternative for staking cryptocurrencies is to enter staking pools. And if you do not trust pools, you can easily do it with more trusted third parties.

Some of these third parties are:

Wallets (like Crypto.com and Exodus);

(like Crypto.com and Exodus); Exchanges (Coinbase, KuCoin, or Binance);

(Where it is possible).

When it comes to delegating, you should be extra cautious. Try delegating only in non-custodial environments and research the third party you’re about to delegate to.

And, of course, avoid every offer that sounds too good to be true.

Key Takeaways

Staking is the process within the Proof of Stake algorithm that involves a node’s appointment to validate the next block.

If a validator does not do his job correctly, he will lose some or even all of his stake.

Some of the best coins to stake are Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), and Polygon (MATIC).

You can start staking cryptos by opening up a node on your own or depositing your stake in a third-party platform like certain wallets or exchanges.

2022-10-31 08:43:37.428938,Business Post Nigeria,Naira Redesigning Good for Economy—Buhari,"By Aduragbemi Omiyale

President Muhammadu Buhari has thrown his full weight behind the decision of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to redesign the higher Naira notes.

Last Wednesday, the Governor of the central bank, Mr Godwin Emefiele, announced plans to change the look of the N200, N500, and N1000 banknotes from December 15, 2022.

While addressing reporters at a special press briefing in Abuja, he disclosed that the old notes would seize to become legal tender in Nigeria from January 31, 2023, urging those with the Naira notes to approach their banks to exchange them for the new ones at no cost.

Two days after this announcement, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, while speaking with the Senate Committee on Finance in Abuja, opposed the Naira redesigning, saying she was not consulted about the issue, noting that she also heard it from the media like every other person, despite being a top member of the fiscal policy team of this government.

On Sunday, in an interview to be aired on Wednesday on Tambari TV on Nilesat, Mr Buhari said he authorised the apex bank to redesign the banknotes because he was convinced that the nation would gain a lot by doing so.

In a statement issued yesterday by Mr Garba Shehu, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Buhari said the economy stands to benefit from a reduction in inflation, currency counterfeiting and the excess cash in circulation just because of the action, which has generated controversies since its announcement.

According to the statement, the President did not consider three months for the change to the new notes as being short, saying, “People with illicit money buried under the soil will have a challenge with this but workers, businesses with legitimate incomes will face no difficulties at all.”

In the Hausa radio interview with the famous journalist Halilu Ahmed Getso and Kamaluddeen Sani Shawai, President Buhari also addressed food security and national security, among others.

2022-10-31 11:43:37.431423,Crypto Economy,Lido DAO (LDO) Price Prediction and Forecast for 2023-2025-2030,"From technical analysis to fundamental price history, this guide will provide you with a clear indication of the Lido DAO price forecast for 2023, 2025, and 2030 by providing a sense of its projected growth.

In the following review, you will be able to get a clearer picture of how the future of the crypto market looks in terms of price movements and how high they are likely to go. You will also be given an insight into the future of LDO at the end of this article. It is a cryptocurrency that is on a fast track to becoming one of the most popular assets in the near future. The purpose of this article is to try to answer a question that many people ask: Is Lido DAO (LDO) a good investment?

In 2025 or the future, what is the estimated value of Lido DAO, or how much will Lido DAO be worth in the near future? Price fluctuations and the ability to predict future prices are one of the most difficult tasks one can face in the financial world. We’ll discuss some possibilities in the next paragraphs.

What is Lido DAO?

There is a platform called Lido that is used to facilitate liquid staking on the Ethereum network. There is no minimum amount that a user has to stake in Ether (ETH), as well as no required maintenance standards when it comes to the infrastructure that runs the platform. Additionally, users of ETH can take part in lending activities, such as investments, in order to receive compound returns on the ETH they stake.

The native token of the platform is LDO. Essentially, the token owners are in charge of governing the Lido DAO and managing various parameters, such as transaction fees, which can be managed by the users. It can be decided whether to add or remove Lido node operators that have already been established.

In addition to being easy to use, the platform also has a great look to it, which is why it attracted quite an audience so quickly. However, due to recent expansions, Lido now also supports Solana, Polkadot, Kusama, and Polygon, as well as a few others that have been added recently.

About Lido DAO Token (LDO)

This system is managed by Lido’s own decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). By holding its LDO token, holders can gain access to this organization and have a vote on the direction it is headed in.

An example of the DAO’s responsibilities is to decide on various parameters, such as fees on the platform, whether oracles (third parties who connect the smart contracts connected to a blockchain to external sources) should be integrated, or whether key nodes ought to be assigned.

A portion of the accumulated fees is also used to fund research and development and other incentives within the company.

Lido DAO (LDO) Price Predictions from 2023-2025-2030

As users voted on whether or not to launch the protocol on Solana in late April 2021, the protocol started its first major rally. As a result of the implementation of the proposal, LDO peaked at $5.61 on 8 May 2021. Despite this psychological barrier, the project was again able to surpass it in August.

There was a huge jump in the price of LDO on 20 August 2021, reaching a high of $7.24. With that said, we will have to wait and see what happens to this coin in the years 2023, 2025, and 2030.

Lido DAO (LDO) Price Prediction 2023

Lido is a protocol that provides the ability for users to stake across multiple blockchains, making it convenient for them to stake. Its goal is to enhance the staking economy in order to strengthen its position in the market by upholding staking.

This could potentially lead to the token’s price chart going very high in the future if that event materializes and breaks the bubble. Until any of these updates are implemented, the price of the coin will fall considerably by the end of 2023 if any of the updates cannot be implemented.

Price Prediction Pages

By 2023, it’s expected that the LDO price will cross the average price level of $4.61, and for Lido DAO Token, the expected minimum price value is estimated at $4.48, whereas the maximum price level is anticipated to be $5.33, according to PricePrediction.

By the beginning of April 2023, the Lido DAO price will reach $1.46623 based on its analysis of TradingBeasts’ market data. There is an expectation that the price will reach $1.83278 at the maximum and $1.2469 at the minimum. It is predicted that the Lido DAO price will touch $1.4662 in December.

Lido DAO (LDO) Price Forecasts 2025

A unique feature of Lido compared to other staking platforms is that it allows users to get staking benefits without having to deal with the infrastructure involved in staked assets.

Stakeholders will be able to gain a diversified spectrum of opportunities as a result of all the upcoming integrations and updates that will be coming in. It is possible that by the end of 2025, its price might rise by a considerable amount.

Having said that, concerns around regulatory compliance may force LDO to set very low prices in order to comply with these regulations.

Price Prediction Pages

According to DigitalCoinPrice, it is expected that the price of LDO will cross the level of $6.59. A minimum fee of $5.72 is expected to be reached by the end of this year by Lido DAO. Additionally, it may be possible for the LDO price to reach a maximum of $6.91 in the future.

The analysis provided by CoinCodex indicates that there may be different situations for the LDO price in 2025 compared to what is currently happening. The price can reach $5.24 in that year if we consider Internet Growth as a fundamental factor for the prediction. It can go up to $26.57 if you look at the Facebook Growth metric, though.

Lido DAO (LDO) Price Prediction 2030

I believe that there will be many developments for LDO as well as the entire crypto ecosystem by the year 2030. As a result of the promise of this project, it is predicted that it will rise to new ATHs during that year. If, however, the challenges and barriers are not resolved by then, we can expect a big dump in the Lido DAO price if the challenges and barriers remain unresolved.

Price Prediction Pages

In 2030, PricePrediction forecasts that the Lido DAO Token price should be able to cross an average price level of $64.90; this means that the minimum price value of the Lido DAO Token by year’s end should be $63.21. The price level of LDO could also reach $72.76 at its maximum.

Combined with a price of $20.83, DigitalCoinPrice anticipates that the price of LDO will cross the threshold of $20.83 by the end of the year. Lido DAO is expected to reach a minimum fee of $20.69. In addition, the LDO price is capable of getting a maximum level of $21.19. Investors and holders of crypto assets must know the Lido DAO Price Prediction 2030.

Is Lido DAO (LDO) coin a good investment?

As a governance token, LDO has been designed to satisfy the needs of its staking platform users. Those who hold a coin can vote on its fees, whether it should integrate new blockchains and how its treasury should be managed by its holders.

In spite of this, before you make any decision to invest in LDO, it is wise to conduct your own research.

In addition to this, cryptocurrency prices can be extremely volatile, and they can go up and down just as readily as they can go up and down. A number of forecasts made by analysts and algorithmic forecasters are incorrect and do happen from time to time.

The performance of an investment in the past does not guarantee the performance of an investment in the future. Invest only money that you can afford to lose, and always do your own research before investing.

It was predicted that the rise would be steady for most online forecasters. However, there have been a number of instances in the past when LDOs have been up and down, and investors should try to avoid investing in more LDO than they can afford to lose.

In addition to earning a yield on staked funds, Lido enables users to keep their staked funds liquid while also participating in other protocols. In order to manage this platform, it has created a token called LDO.

Conclusion

It is important to note that there is no correlation between the current value and the future price of the Lido DAO Token. Although this can be an important determining factor during the market’s growth and development stage, it is also dependent on other factors. LDO’s future will be determined by these variables, so let us take a closer look at them.

The topic could also be the subject of a study that you conduct on your own. Token holders can be of great assistance to you if you are a first-time buyer in this market and need assistance in making a decision. There is no easy way to know in advance how much the value of any particular cryptocurrency will be due to the volatile nature of the crypto market.

LDO has been an established cryptocurrency for a good amount of time, and it has performed well to this point. If you are considering investing in Lido DAO Token, it is a good idea to wait for market dumps before investing large sums of money in the token.

The Price Predictions published in this article are based on estimates made by industry professionals, they are not investment recommendations, and it should be understood that these predictions may not occur as described.

2022-10-31 09:43:37.445387,RecentlyHeard,Terra Classic (LUNC) Gets A New Shooter Game On Unity Play,"The Dogecoin (DOGE) price has had an incredible weekend. Following Elon Musk’s confirmed Twitter acquisition, the DOGE price jumped 95% over the last seven days. The memecoin exploded to over $0.14 at times and is currently sitting at about $0.11.

Musk’s gigantic influence on the DOGE price is an old acquaintance for the crypto market. Over the past few years, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO kept moving the price with his statements. But since the Twitter acquisition, he has gone quiet. Musk has not mentioned Dogecoin since the deal was closed.

However DOGE fans remember April when Musk floated the idea of letting Twitter users pay with Dogecoin for his premium subscription service, Twitter Blue. Currently, rumors are circulating that Musk plans to have all users pay $20 for a blue check mark.

Some Tesla products can already be purchased on the automaker’s website using Dogecoin. The Boring Company accepts the cryptocurrency as payment for using the Las Vegas Loop.

Not everyone believes that Musk has good intentions. In June, a $258 billion lawsuit was filed against Musk, SpaceX and Tesla for manipulating the DOGE price. In September, the lawsuit was expanded to include seven new investors and six new defendants, including his tunneling company, Boring Co.

According to the lawsuit, Musk and the other defendants intentionally drove up the price of Dogecoin by more than 36,000% over two years and then caused it to crash. In doing so, the defendants “made tens of billions of dollars at the expense of other investors,” according to the complaint.

Are Dogecoin Whales Manipulating The Price?

But it’s not just Elon Musk, other whales seem to be setting the tone for the Dogecoin price as well. As new on-chain data shows, there were three whale alerts yesterday. The largest whale transferred 450 million DOGE, while the seventh largest whale received 10 million DOGE. In total, 402 million flowed out of Binance.

The price of DOGE surpassed $0.10 for the first time since May 2022 on Saturday, with a 24-hour gain of nearly 30%. An anonymous on-chain analyst posted the table below, which shows the latest 30-day holdings change of the top 10 holders of DOGE.

According to the analysis, it can be seen that two addresses are highly correlated with the price of DOGE. One of them is the largest whale, the exchange Robinhood, which transferred a total of 1.05B DOGE ($107.4M) on October 05, October 28 and October 29. Not elaborating what this means, it can be assumed that Robinhood is gathering a lot of retail interest for DOGE.

Further, the analyst notes that coincidentally, the address “DPDLBA” transferred 1.35B DOGE in early August. After the transfer, the price of DOGE exceeded $0.85 and reached its highest level after May.

The top-7 holder of DOGE is the other address impacting the market. From October 6th, the address received 5M or 10M DOGE every day. He also received 10M DOGE on Saturday and “it doesn’t seem to stop”.

“The last time address ‘DMuFDC’ received DOGE started on July 26 and stopped on August 5, after which the price of $DOGE started to rise. Now that he is still receiving $DOGE, does it mean that the price of $DOGE will continue to rise?”, the analyst concluded.","The Dogecoin (DOGE) price has had an incredible weekend.
