2022-10-31 11:24:53.146695,Axios,Did Dogecoin sales help Musk fund Twitter? It's possible,"It's possible — unlikely, but possible — that Elon Musk paid for a very large chunk of Twitter with billions of dollars he made investing in dogecoin, a joke cryptocurrency that Musk pumped aggressively in 2021 as it rose sharply in value.

Why it matters: We don't know — and might never know — who Musk's co-investors in Twitter are, and therefore who he's beholden to. We also don't know — and will never know — just how much Musk is worth.

The estimates of his net worth are just that — estimates — and could be wildly off, especially if he made a lot of money in crypto.

The intrigue: A dogecoin ""whale"" started buying millions of dollars of the cryptocurrency in February 2019. We know this because all transactions are public on the blockchain. We just don't know the identity of that whale.

By the numbers: The owner of this wallet ended up spending a net total of $382 million on dogecoin by February 2021.

Then the sales started — $9.876 billion in total.

The final profit: $9,469,897,692.

Be smart: We have no idea whether Musk is the owner of this wallet, although he has said that Dogecoin is one of only three cryptocurrencies that he's ever invested in.

We similarly don't have any kind of cap table for Twitter — a list of its new shareholders. We know that Musk is at the top of the list, and that crypto exchange Binance is in for $500 million. But most details of the ownership of Twitter are extremely murky.

The bottom line: As a private company, Twitter has very few reporting obligations. Eventually, if it issues bonds, some financials will become public. But for the time being, it's pretty much a black box.","It's possible — unlikely, but possible — that Elon Musk paid for a very large chunk of Twitter with billions of dollars he made investing in dogecoin, a joke cryptocurrency that Musk pumped aggressively in 2021 as it rose sharply in value.

DOGE’s price rallied on Oct. 26 when billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk changed his Twitter bio to “Chief of Twit.” The same day, he visited Twitter’s San Francisco-based headquarters before officially closing the deal as the new owner on Oct. 28.

In the past seven days, DOGE’s price has surged 98.5% to $0.119 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko.

This means that as much as 62% of DOGE holders are “Making Money at Current Price,” according to data from blockchain intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, which even beats out Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) hodlers at 54% and 57%, respectively.

The events have also triggered DOGE’s market cap to surpass smart contract platforms’ native tokens Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) into becoming the 8th largest cryptocurrency in the world with a $16.3 billion market cap, according to CoinGecko.

The link between Musk’s Twitter purchase and DOGE’s massive price surge should come as no surprise as many Dogecoin investors have high hopes for Musk — nicknamed The Dogefather — to integrate Dogecoin into Twitter in some shape or form.

Dogecoin fanatic and crypto blogger Matt Wallace told his 678,400 followers on Oct. 28 that he believes a Dogecoin-integrated Twitter would showcase “what #Dogecoin is capable of:”

Thanks to Elon Musk, Twitter will soon showcase to the entire world what #Dogecoin is capable of! — Matt Wallace (@MattWallace888) October 28, 2022

While Dogecoin fan page Doge Whisperer speculated that a Dogecoin-based tip system could be implemented for popular tweets:

Can’t wait for Twitter to add #dogecoin as an option for tipping



What do you think @elonmusk ? pic.twitter.com/b7Eqz9hpEs — Doge Whisperer (@TDogewhisperer) October 30, 2022

Even Cardano CEO and founder Charles Hoskinson has weighed in — stating there is now a “real possibility” of Dogecoin integrating on to Twitter:

Now that Twitter is in the hands of @elonmusk I can see a real possibility that doge will somehow merge with the platform. — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) October 28, 2022

Hoskinson then went one step further by offering to migrate Dogecoin onto Cardano as a sidechain with embedded smart contract functionality for free.

2022-10-31 11:24:53.176119,The Daily Hodl,Crypto Insights Firm Says Shiba Inu Could Abruptly Follow Dogecoin Rally As SHIB Gains Steam Against Bitcoin,"A leading crypto analytics firm says dog-themed coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) could be playing a game of follow the leader with fellow meme token Dogecoin (DOGE).

Santiment says that Shiba Inu is starting to gather some momentum after displaying strength in its Bitcoin pair (SHIB/BTC).

“Whatever side of the fence your on with memecoins like DOGE and SHIB, there is no denying that they have had their pump moments. Shiba Inu has historically followed Dogecoin pumps. Watch trading volume on our chart.”

According to Santiment’s chart, Shiba Inu bulls are showing signs of life as the SHIB/BTC pair witnesses a significant rise in volume, suggesting that traders are betting on the meme token outperforming Bitcoin.

At time of writing, Shiba Inu is changing hands for $0.000013, up over 8% on the day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading a $20,800, up a little over 1% in the past 24 hours.

In addition to crypto traders, blockchain tracker WhaleStats shows that the largest 5,000 Ethereum whales have also been accumulating SHIB over the last few days. According to WhaleStats, the top 5,000 ETH whales hold over $94.2 million worth of SHIB, an increase of 4.5% from their Shiba Inu trove of $89.7 million, which was recorded on Friday.

Looking at Bitcoin itself, Santiment reveals that long-term bulls continue to stash away the largest crypto by market cap as BTC supply on crypto exchanges plummet to a level last seen in November 2018.

“With Bitcoin back above $20,700, traders appear to be content with long-term holding as coins continue moving away from exchanges. With the ratio of BTC on exchanges down to 8.3%, it’s the lowest seen in four years. October has been a big outflow month.”

DOGE has surged by 120% in the last 7 days and Shiba Inu has moved higher by 31% as well. Other digital currencies such as Binance Coin (BNB) and Cardano (ADA) have also moved higher by over 15% during the same period of time.

Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Skyrocket as Elon Musk Takes Over Twitter

Elon Musk has started a new bullish period of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu as these two virtual currencies registered massive gains in recent days. At the end of last week, Elon Musk closed a deal to take over Twitter and some changes are already visible on the social media network.

Elon Musk has been a key supporter of Dogecoin over the last few years. He is considered to be one of the most influential figures in the crypto market, and his declarations, have many times moved the market, affecting especially DOGE. Investors in the crypto market are now waiting for further integrations between Twitter and DOGE or even Bitcoin.

Nevertheless, Bitcoin has lagged behind altcoins during the last 7 days. For example, the digital currency has moved higher just by 8.5% during this time. This shows that market players are paying close attention to what is happening with DOGE and Shiba Inu (or other digital assets) rather than on Bitcoin. These are usually speculative moves that help short-term investors bet on the price movement of DOGE and SHIB.

Dogecoin has now reached a price per coin of $0.1297 per coin and a market capitalization of $18 billion, surpassing Cardano, Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC). This shows the strength that DOGE gained in recent days. At the same time, if it continues to move higher, we could see DOGE surpassing Binance USD (BUSD) and XRP.

While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are more related to social media trends and forum discussions (for example during the GameStop market manipulation in early 2021) than to fundamentals. Despite that, there are some positive things to mention about DOGE and SHIB. Dogecoin could get integrated into different Twitter solutions if Elon Musk decides to bring crypto to Twitter.

There will be a prioritization of DOGE rather than Bitcoin, which could bring additional flows to Dogecoin in the near future. The case for SHIB being used at Twitter is more limited though. SHIB usually follows DOGE’s trend but tends to lag behind with a few exceptions. Therefore, the market should be ready to see volatility in altcoins, especially DOGE and SHIB in the coming months.

Bitcoin, instead, is more correlated to macro economic trends linked to central banking and traditional finance. These are two different types of assets (BTC and DOGE), which require different analytical frameworks to understand what could happen to them. One thing is clear, if Bitocin moves higher, then other altcoins follow most of the times. At the time of writing this article, Bitcoin is being traded at close to $20,850 and it has a market capitalization of $400 billion.","Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), the two largest “meme coins” in the crypto market have skyrocketed in recent hours.

Why It Matters: While the two largest coins, Bitcoin and Ethereum, were in the red, the rise in Dogecoin continued unabated.

The meme coin has shot up a whopping 103.85%, buoyed by Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter, in the last seven days. In the same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have risen 5.3% and 16.5%, respectively.

Dogecoin’s 24-hour trading volume declined 35.76% to $8.03 billion at the time of writing. Coinglass data indicated that $27.58 million worth of DOGE was liquidated over 24 hours.

On Sunday evening, the two cryptocurrencies with the largest market cap were seen trading in negative territory with other major risk assets like stocks. U.S. stock futures were marginally in the red.

This week, investors will be on the lookout for the latest policy meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve which commences Tuesday.

Going forward into the fresh trading week, there has been a marked improvement in investor sentiment. Alternative.me’s “Crypto Fear & Greed Index” was seen pointing to “Fear” at the time of writing.

The index showed a value of 31, last week it was at “22” and flashed “Extreme Fear.” A value of 0 on the measure is construed as “Extreme Fear,” while 100 is “Extreme Greed.”

Cryptocurrency trader Michaël van de Poppe said that the “markets are indeed waking up, profits are made left and right.”

BNB sets new record against BTC

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirms that BNB/BTC briefly spiked above 0.15 BTC to a record 0.15267 BTC on Oct. 30.

BNB, the in-house token of Binance, the largest crypto exchange by volume, has gained around 10% in the past 72 hours.

The strong performance came on the back of reports that Binance was preparing to assist Twitter in eradicating bots as part of its new direction under Elon Musk.

Binance had contributed $500 million to Musk’s takeover of the social media platform.

“Our intern says we wired the $500 million 2 days ago, probably just as I was being asked about Elon/Twitter,” Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao wrote in a cryptic tweet referencing comments he made to crypto media outlet Decrypt.

Further posts from CZ stated, “Let’s unleash the bird,” and “Crypto Twitter,” the former appearing to be referencing Musk’s own tweet, “the bird is freed.”

In U.S. dollar terms, meanwhile, BNB hit highs of $318.80 on the day, its best performance since mid-August.

Dogecoin ""copies itself"" as it runs to April highs

Musk was also responsible for outperformance of another popular cryptocurrency in recent days — Dogecoin (DOGE).

In a familiar setup, actions by Musk linked to Twitter sent DOGE price action into a frenzy, with DOGE/USD hitting its highest levels since April.

Long a pet favorite of Musk, DOGE is still waiting for its shot at a wider use application, possibly with his involvement.

In the meantime, popular pseudonymous analyst Tree of Alpha suggests retail traders may do the work, helped by both the Twitter and Binance ecosystems.

“Another ATH in complete silence as the dog coin longers rejoice,” they wrote about BNB, adding:

“Imagine the smell when launchpads become a thing again and retail is back to turbo buying garbage on BSC. Are you actually fading the token that backs the biggest exchange & the most degenerate evm chain by far?”

Bulls went berserk as investors considered the possibility of Dogecoin being utilized as payment on social media following the successful conclusion of the Twitter deal.

On a daily basis, most larger-cap altcoins have leveled down, with BNB, XRP, ADA, and SOL posting slight increases. However, the situation with Dogecoin (DOGE) is quite different. The largest memecoin increased by more than 20% in a single day when Elon Musk chose to install a sink in Twitter’s offices ahead of the purchase agreement. Most crypto analysts have been attributing the market pump to Elon Musk and the Twitter purchase, but seeing as DOGE seems to be the biggest gainer of the situation, it might just be it.

Dogecoin (DOGE)

Dogecoin (DOGE) is the largest and first memecoin in the cryptocurrency market. The memecoin set a precedent for the several hundreds of memecoins to come after. And while a huge percentage of them adopted the dog mascot, there are a few others who tried to create independent success. Dogecoin has inspired several other memecoin projects, and while some of them made their users money, only Shiba Inu (SHIB) was able to make it out of DOGE’s shadow.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) revolutionized the memecoin landscape and demonstrated the power of creating utility. Before SHIB, the precedent set by Dogecoin was that they would have no use other than memes and internet jokes. SHIB utilized DeFi to create wealth for its holders, and the community grew to surpass Dogecoin for some hours in November 2021 at the market’s peak.

Today, Shiba Inu has an ecosystem that feeds itself. Using innovative DeFi products, it has created other notable tokens like BONE, LEASH, etc. The SHIB community is also building a metaverse that would further enhance community interaction and help the community grow its influence on other landscapes.

Rocketize Token (JATO)

Rocketize Token (JATO) is a new memecoin project launching on the Binance Smart Chain and looks to help its holders create wealth while pushing meme narratives and internet jokes. Like Shiba Inu, it aims to create wealth using several DeFi features at its disposal. Being on the BNB Chain gives it an advantage in terms of easy onboarding of users, scalability, and user interaction. Rocketize (JATO) is primed to be the next big thing, and it is why investors are buying up the token fast on presale.

Rocketize Token takes a different approach and does not use the dog mascot or any of the contemporary memes in the market. Rocketize (JATO) represents the aim of the project to ‘aim for the moon,’ which is slang for massive price pumps in the cryptocurrency market. JATO will serve as the utility and governance token for the ecosystem.

JATO will enable community holders to stake and have veto power over decisions made in the ecosystem. Users can send proposals and vote for consensus on major matters of the project. Rocketize Token (JATO) is still selling fast on its presale; join here now and be early.

,Evening Standard,Revolut customers given cashback in Dogecoin with launch of new crypto card,"B rits will soon be able to buy a pint of milk with Dogecoin as fintech firm Revolut launches a crypto card in the UK.

Revolut’s Pay with Crypto feature offers customers a 1% cashback in crypto for purchases paid with any of the close to 100 supported tokens, including Dogecoin, Bitcoin and Ethereum. The cashback is paid out in the same currency that the spend is in – so if the spend is in Dogecoin the 1% cashback is also paid out in Dogecoin.

The new feature can be activated on any existing card, allowing customers to switch between the currencies they spend from, including digital currencies.

Alongside the launch, Revolut has created a series of ‘Learn & Earn’ courses designed to help customers improve their knowledge of cryptocurrencies and related topics, including blockchains, and the most popular tokens and protocols.

Emil Urmanshin, Revolut’s Crypto General Manager, said: “This year we have not only increased the number of cryptocurrencies available in the Revolut app to close to 100 tokens and launched Crypto Learn & Earn education courses enjoyed by millions of our customers.

What crypto exchanges are saying about the current market scenario

Mudrex co-founder and CEO Edul Patel told ABP Live, “Bitcoin continues to trade below the $21,000 level over the past 24 hours. BTC is consolidated under the resistance of $21,000. If BTC can trade sideways this week, bulls may lose further and drop to the nearest support line. If demand grows slightly today, we might soon see BTC retesting the $21,000 level. If bulls lose momentum, BTC might go down to $20,300 and then to $19,600.”

Sathvik Vishwanath, the co-founder and CEO of Unocoin, said, ""Markets are rising in anticipation of a global economic slowdown that will prompt the Fed to potentially ease its hawkish stance. Markets still expect a 75 bps hike at the upcoming FOMC meeting, however, the odds of a 50 bps hike have increased slightly. The US Fed is due to announce its interest rate revisions on November 2. Dogecoin (DOGE) saw the most significant movement. As the announcement of Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter hit the headlines, the meme coin rallied around 40 percent over the past week.""

weTrade founder Prashant Kumar offered his take on the market scenario as well, ""Diwali bonanza seems to continue for crypto investors as the global market cap saw an approximately 5 per cent rise over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin rallied and broke the $20,000 mark for the first time in three weeks. Ethereum also saw big gains of approximately 10.5 per cent, taking it closer to $1,500. Positive momentum around the appointment of UK prime minister Rishi Sunak and global markets also helped the market.”

Shivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, “Investors who were betting on the price rise of Bitcoin, liquidated their positions which resulted in a short squeeze, creating bullish sentiment around the world’s largest cryptocurrency. The overall crypto market cap is above the $1 trillion mark, mainly driven by the growth momentum of crypto heavyweights like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Elon Musk’s Twitter deal is shaking the meme coin space with significant price movements of SHIB and DOGE. The next US Fed meeting is lined up for November and any rate hike will have a considerable impact on the market in the coming months. UK’s CPI data is also expected next month and will have a considerable impact on the prices of crypto assets across the board.”

2022-10-31 09:24:53.749320,Decrypt,"Elon Musk, Twitter, Dogecoin, Bluesky, and the Decentralized Social Media Race","Elon actually did it. The gleeful jester king of Crypto Twitter—whose tweets about Dogecoin have repeatedly moved the price, whose July 2018 ""pedo guy"" tweet about a British cave diver landed him in court for defamation (he won), whose August 2018 ""funding secured"" tweet led to securities fraud charges from the SEC ($20 million fine)—now owns the company.

When this story began six months ago (!) with Musk's original $44 billion offer, I wrote, ""Musk probably won't get to buy Twitter. But crypto advocates should be cheering him on if they want to see Twitter ever really embrace crypto tools."" I was wrong on the first count; the second is still unanswered, but is heating up fast.

Musk originally said, both publicly and in private (since-leaked) text messages, that he aimed to put Twitter on-chain and make it open-source, accept Dogecoin for payments for Twitter services, and go after crypto spam bots.

But then, in texts with a representative for FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, Musk wrote, ""Blockchain Twitter isn’t possible. The bandwidth and latency requirements cannot be supported by a peer to peer network, unless those ‘peers’ are absolutely gigantic, thus defeating the purpose of a decentralized network.""

And yet! Binance, the biggest crypto exchange in the world, backed Musk's final buy to the tune of $500 million, and is ""creating an internal team to focus on ways that blockchain and crypto could be helpful to Twitter,"" the company told Decrypt on Friday. Binance believes it has Musk's ear.

Regardless of your opinion of Musk, anyone who believes in the future viability of crypto and blockchain solutions and would like to see more mass adoption should be excited to see what happens next.

Twitter users who are loudly railing against his ownership and threatening to leave will mostly not leave. The irony is that if they do, many of their other options also now have a crypto connection.

Facebook is so committed to the metaverse it renamed its company Meta, and even after its metaverse division Reality Labs lost $3.6 billion in Q3, sending the stock plummeting more than 25%, it must double down on the strategy. It is unclear how much Meta's metaverse will utilize crypto and blockchain, but recall that the company already tried to create its own cryptocurrency once before.

Jack Dorsey, clearly a confidante of Musk who might counsel him on what to do at Twitter, has departed Twitter to focus on Block, formerly Square, which, like Facebook, was so intent on publicly proving its commitment to a new area of tech that it changed its corporate name. But Dorsey's separate ""decentralized social media"" effort Bluesky—birthed inside Twitter and now independent—has just launched a web site for its AT Protocol (it stands for Authenticated Transport) and opened the waitlist for its Bluesky app, which the team frames as a ""browser"" for accessing the AT Protocol.

Bluesky is pursuing Dorsey's vision of putting Twitter onto a protocol—just don't call it blockchain (or Web3, since Dorsey doesn't believe in that).

This article uses the word ""blockchain"" 7 times and describes the @at_protocol as a ""blockchain-based social media platform"", but please take a closer look at our design: there's no blockchain. https://t.co/5KiDOyn9i4 — Jay Graber (@arcalinea) October 20, 2022

Even Kanye West is in the mix with Parler, the right-wing social media app he is buying. Parler launched an NFT marketplace in March called DeepRedSky that debuted with a Trump NFT collection. Kanye himself has praised Bitcoin and was recently spotted wearing a Satoshi Nakamoto cap.

Discord backed away from crypto wallet integration due to outrage from gamers, but remains the most popular home for DAOs, the crypto organizations that run on community voting.

Mastodon, a ""decentralized social media platform"" launched in 2016 that uses a network of open-source servers, gained 30,000 new signups on the day Musk bought Twitter.

Even though some of these apps I've listed would say they have nothing to do with crypto, it's striking that so many social media platforms are looking at using decentralization, the utopian rallying cry of the crypto industry, to improve their UX or foster free speech.

I first wrote about Bitcoin in 2011, and what excited me most back then was the possibility of using crypto to pay for a paywalled news article, without the friction of entering your credit card info and subscribing for a whole year.

Many Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) investors, following their poor performance, are shifting to a newer project, Flasko.

Flasko is still in its presale stage and has shown the potential to deliver outstanding results in 2023.

Solana (SOL) Is Not Delivering Profits Anymore

Solana (SOL) is a 4th generation cryptocurrency. It is based upon an open infrastructure, with the objective of boosting quantifiability.

Solana (SOL) is quite an impressive cryptocurrency network as well. Solana (SOL) is using the latest available technology to deliver unprecedented data transferring speeds and enterprise-grade security to users.

Since Solana (SOL) came to the market in 2017, cryptocurrency has experienced rapid growth. However, the growth came to a halt along with its merger with Ethereum (ETH).

Dogecoin (DOGE) Is Not Doing Well For The Rest Of 2022 And 2023

Dogecoin (DOGE) is quite an old cryptocurrency. It was initially introduced to the crypto world back in the year 2013. In fact, the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto directly influenced in the creation of this meme coin.

Behind Dogecoin (DOGE), you can find the same algorithm behind Litecoin (LTC). However, there was no solid project backing up the cryptocurrency. People knew it as just another meme coin. From the beginning of 2022, Dogecoin (DOGE) has lost its overall value by around 24%. This will continue for the rest of 2022 and 2023 as well.

Flasko (FLSK) Will Be A Good Investment For 2023

Among different cryptocurrencies that show potential to grow in 2023, Flasko is making a noise in the crypto community.

Through Flasko, anyone will be able to purchase NFTsbacked up with real-world investments in premium luxury beverages such as wines, champagnes, and whiskeys.

The current value of Flasko is only $0.065. This is expected to grow by 4,000% in the year 2023. Therefore, investing in Flasko right now is indeed a good idea.

Since the investment is locked with liquidity for 33 years, Flasko would be one of the safest investments to consider.

DOGE extended its rally and it cleared the $0.1000 and $0.1200 resistance levels against the US dollar.

The price is trading well above the $0.1000 zone and the 100-day simple moving average.

There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $0.070 on the daily chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

The pair is correcting gains, but the bulls might remain active near the $0.10 zone.

Dogecoin Rallies To New Multi-Week High

This past week, dogecoin saw a strong bullish wave from the $0.055 support zone. DOGE rallied significantly above the $0.070 resistance, outpacing bitcoin and ethereum.

There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $0.070 on the daily chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The pair rallied over 100% and broke many hurdles near the $0.10 level. It even climbed above $0.12 and traded as high as $0.1513.

Recently, it started a downside correction below the $0.135 level. The price traded below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent surge from the $0.0551 swing low to $0.1513 high.

However, the price is trading well above the $0.1000 zone and the 100-day simple moving average. An initial support is near the $0.1100 level. The first key support is near the $0.1000 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent surge from the $0.0551 swing low to $0.1513 high.

If there is a downside break below the $0.1000 support, the price could correct further. The main support is forming near the $0.0920 and $0.0900 levels. Any more losses could open the doors for a move towards the $0.0800 level.

More Gains in DOGE?

If DOGE price remains stable above the $0.1000 support, there are chances of more gains. An initial resistance on the upside is near the $0.1250 level.

The first major resistance is near the $0.1320 level. Any more gains above the $0.1320 zone could encourage the bulls to aim a test the important $0.15 level.

,Proactive Investors,"Dogecoin (DOGE) continues its Elon Musk rally, but is a correction on the way?","Elon Musk has long been a fan of Dogecoin (DOGE), even making it an official payment option for Tesla merchandise

Last Thursday, I mentioned that Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 25% rally was absolute peanuts compared to the 1,200% moonshot we saw in May 2021.

Well, the rally has steamed ahead and DOGE’s market capitalisation is more than double what it was a week ago.

At over US$16.2bn, the Shiba Inu-themed meme coin now has a greater market value than top-tier network tokens Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL) and Polygon (MATIC).

Elation among Elon Musk (a Dogecoin uber-fan) cheerleaders across Twitter is at a fever pitch, and for good reason; his final takeover of the social media platform caused this latest rally, just like his Saturday Night Live appearance caused the last one.

Speculation has it that Musk intends to integrate DOGE into Twitter somehow, whether by making it a payment option for Premium services, or some other form of blockchain-based integration.

There is precedent to back this speculation up- earlier this year, he made DOGE an official payment option in the Tesla merchandise store.

As of today, Musk has yet to comment on the top meme dog, but it is more than likely that Twitter and the blockchain have a future together.

Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange that invested $500mln million into Musk's Twitter takeover, is putting together a team to work on how blockchain and crypto could become integrated with the social media platform, a company spokesperson said on Friday.

Speculation will no doubt continue, but how long can hype sustain this rally?

Dogecoin is without a doubt, extremely overbought right now.

The relative strength index – a technical indicator that assesses an asset’s overbought or oversold position – is the second highest it has ever been (just below last May 2021’s SNL rally).

DOGE’s relative strength index (purple) shows the meme coin’s highly overbought position – Source: currency.com

Signs of retracement can already be observed, with DOGE’s price around 4% down day on day. A deeper correction is almost a given, the question is by how much?

When DOGE hit an all-time high (ATH) on May 8, 2021, the coin fell back around 50% in the following two weeks.

In more bullish terms, DOGE remained 537% up compared to its pre-rally exchange price.

But the stakes are different today. Last year, the crypto markets were entering their best season of all time; this year the crypto winter is in danger of turning into an ice age.

Dogecoin’s red-hot rally could soon face some chilly headwinds, as the euphoria subsides and speculators cash out their short-term winnings.

Trading volumes have already collapsed over 60% in the past two days alone.

But who knows? Maybe tomorrow Dogecoin will become the official currency of Twitter and the fabled US$1 price point finally becomes a reality.","Elon Musk has long been a fan of Dogecoin (DOGE), even making it an official payment option for Tesla merchandiseLast Thursday, I mentioned that Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 25% rally was absolute peanuts compared to the 1,200% moonshot we saw in May 2021.

2022-10-31 10:24:54.275882,Bankless Times,Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE is Ripe for a Pullback,"Dogecoin price has had a strong performance in the past few weeks as investors cheer Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter. DOGE surged to a high of $0.1515, which was about 175% above the lowest level in October, bringing its market cap to over $15 billion. This makes it the eighth-biggest coin in the world. Other top meme coins like Dogelon Mars, Shiba Inu, Tamadoge and Floki Inu have all rebounded.

Why did DOGE surge?

Dogecoin price went parabolic as one of its biggest supporters acquired the most influential social media company in the world. Elon Musk concluded his Twitter buyout last week. The move cemented him as the biggest investors in some of the leading industries.

Musk owns Tesla, the biggest automaker in the world by market cap. He also owns SpaceX, a company that has become the most important in the space industry. Musk also owns The Boring Company, a firm that seeks to change city travel in the United States.

Dogecoin price rose because Musk, the richest person on earth, has supported it. It is believed that he is one of its biggest holders. As such, investors believe that Musk will introduce Dogecoin as a payment option for Twitter’s subscription products he has promised to build.

How to buy Dogecoin.

So, will DOGE rally continue? I believe that investors are getting ahead of themselves. For one, it is unclear whether Musk will introduce Dogecoin payments in Twitter. And if he does, there is a likelihood that it will not become a popular payment option.

There is evidence to support this. Musk introduced Dogecoin as a payment option for Tesla’s accessories a few months ago. Since then, it is unclear whether more people are buying these accessories using the coin.

At the same time, there are chances that the excitement of his Twitter buyout will fade in the coming weeks.

Dogecoin price prediction

The daily chart shows that the DOGE price has been in a strong bullish trend in the past few days. As a result, the coin has moved above the 25-day and 50-day volume-weighted moving averages. This is a sign that bulls are in control.

A closer look shows that Dogecoin’s Relative Strength Index has formed a bearish divergence pattern. At the same time, volume bars have started falling while the price volume trend (PVT) has stalled. Therefore, there is a likelihood that Dogecoin will likely resume the bearish trend in the coming days. If this happens, the next key support to watch will be at $0.10.","Dogecoin price has had a strong performance in the past few weeks as investors cheer Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter.

2022-10-31 08:24:54.294482,Watcher Guru,"Has XRP been faring better than Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin?","The past week has been pretty monotonous for the sixth largest crypto asset. Post noting a negligible 0.89% incline, XRP’s price has been stuck around the same level where it was 7-days ago.

Contrastingly, Bitcoin and Ethereum have rallied by 6.2% and 18.5% on the weekly. Dogecoin, on the other hand, has appreciated by a whooping 101% in the same time frame.

On the on-chain front, XRP was the sixth most active chain at press time. All the other networks of the aforementioned cryptos, along with Cardano and Litecoin, stood higher than XRP.

After more than $430 million in volume on its blockchain over the past 24 hours, XRP made $431 via fee. The number was around double for Litecoin, while others reaped even more.

Alongside, the number of active XRP addresses have also been hovering around a level as low as 50k. Simply put, an address is considered to be active when it becomes a direct participant in a successful transaction. The said metric, evidently, shares a direct correlation to the price, and its current underwhelming state is perhaps one of the reasons why the asset’s price has not been able to take off.

Ripple CTO reverts to ‘XRP price is a disgrace’ claim

Recently, a user went on to claim on Twitter that the token’s price was a “disgrace.” However, the protocol’s Chief Technological Officer—David Schwartz—contended that such was the case only if one cherry-picked timeframes.

Schwartz further went on to highlight that Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP were trading at $47k, $3.7k and $0.85 at the beginning of year. From the said levels, the respective assets’ prices are roughly 56%, 57%, and 45% down, leaving XRP in a comparatively less devastated state.

Maybe if you cherry-pick timeframes, but it seems to me that it mostly does the same things every other cryptocurrency does.

Early in 2021, Dogecoin experienced tremendous growth, and its market capitalization surpassed an astounding $90 billion. However, last May, its wild run came to an abrupt end.

In the early part of this year, Dogecoin failed to break out of the huge bear channel despite numerous attempts. However, according to data from CoinMarketCap, the satirical crypto is on a rally once more, rising by more than 94%.

Considering that Dogecoin is still down a breathtaking 84.26% from its all-time high of $0.731578, those who purchased it at its peak are still seated on significant losses. However, those who believe that the Twitter-driven rally could start a new bull run may find that Dogecoin is a compelling investment at its current price. DOGE is currently trading at $0.1152, with a 24-hour loss in value of 12.9%. Dogecoin Bear Market Has Ended, Says Peter Brandt 3

Charles Hoskinson tweets that Dogecoin finally has a use case

Charles Hoskinson, the creator of Cardano, proposed developing a new version of the primary meme coin called post-quantum ultrafast DOGE on Cardano. Cardano Sidechain Should Be Related To DOGE, Says Charles Hoskinson Despite receiving 80% of the vote in favor, Billy Markus, the man who created Dogecoin, did not agree with Hoskinson’s proposal.

Markus claims that the founder of Cardano is being hypocritical in his offer because he previously detested DOGE and even made a video in which he very harshly referred to DOGE as a bubble in April 2021. Charles Hoskinson @IOHK_Charles @BillyM2k Dogecoin finally has a use case. If elon decides to use it for twitter, then there are automatically 200 million users and a usecase.

Hoskinson disputed that assertion by stating that DOGE would gain widespread adoption and a 200 million-strong user base once Elon Musk incorporates DOGE into Twitter. The founder of DOGE believes that does not, at least not yet, change the situation.

It is amusing that DOGE has surpassed ADA in CoinMarketCap’s ranking of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, thanks to the price movement of recent days, given the Cardano and Dogecoin disputes.","Trader Peter Brandt claims in a recent tweet that meme coin Dogecoin has already started a new bull market cycle.

Enjin Coin (ENJ): NFT Utility Token

Enjin Coin is one of Enjin’s projects, being a firm that offers a network of interconnected, blockchain-based gaming devices. Its main project is the Enjin Network, a communal gaming platform where users can build websites and clans, communicate, and run virtual goods stores.

Enjin Coin or ENJ was created to be the native currency of the Enjin Network. Enjin Coin (ENJ) is an ERC-20 token driven by the Ethereum (ETH) network and capable of running smart contracts, allowing the purchase, sale, and exchange of goods with real-world value. Enjin Coin (ENJ) also serves as a utility token for NFTs.

The total supply of ENJ is one billion coins, however as the ecosystem develops and more tokens are integrated into in-game digital assets, less ENJ will be in circulation. ENJ’s total circulating supply was 1,000,000,000 at the time of press, and its market capitalization remained at $414,436,500. ENJ was recently worth $0.42.

Dogecoin (DOGE): The Supreme Meme Coin

Dogecoin (DOGE) is a well-known peer-to-peer digital currency that is open-sourced. Dogecoin modelled after a well-known “doge” Internet meme and has a Shiba Inu dog as its emblem. The currency was created to mock the buzz surrounding several cryptos in the altcoin market. Dogecoin (DOGE) is fundamentally an “meme” development that has since gained a lot of support as a community driven project.

The Dogecoin (DOGE) manifesto’s ethos amply demonstrates the cryptocurrency’s core ideals, which include but are not restricted to offering utility, dependability, and ultimately fostering an atmosphere of trust.

At the time of press, the market capitalization of Dogecoin (DOGE) remains at $8,118,799,083. The price of Dogecoin (DOGE) was recently $0.058, but it is now at $0.059 after rising 0.99% during the previous week. However, Dogecoin (DOGE) may reach $0.33 in 2023 if the long-term mood continues favourable.

Orbeon Protocol (ORBN): An Uncommon Investment Platform That Differs

Orbeon Protocol, one of the first cryptocurrency crowdfunding platforms in the world, allows people to invest in a number of early-stage companies on a fractional basis via NFTs.

The Orbeon Protocol ecosystem is disrupting the traditional venture capital and crowdfunding industry by enabling companies and investors to transition seamlessly from the Web2 to the Web3 world. The everyday investor now has the ability to buy into the most promising startups for as little as low as $1. Orbeon Protocol allows projects to raise money through fractional NFTs, exponentially increasing the reach and growth potential of businesses on the platform. To safeguard investors, Orbeon Protocol has a unique rug-proofing mechanism in place called the “Fill or Kill” mechanism that refunds investors should the business fail to reach its funding goal.

There will be 888,000,000 ORBN in circulation with only 40% of the total supply being immediately offered for phase 1 presale to the general public, with prices beginning at $0.004. Analysts predict that the presale price of ORBN will grow by 6,000% to $0.24. This unprecedented potential is what is driving the buzz behind what could be a blue-chip investment for many crypto enthusiasts.

Ainsi, en 7 jours, la capitalisation du memecoin a plus de doublé, au point de dépasser celle des blockchains Solana (SOL) et Cardano (ADA).

Grande semaine pour le Dogecoin (DOGE)

Cette semaine a été bonne pour l'ensemble des cryptomonnaies suite à une remontée du Bitcoin (BTC), résultat de la conjonction de facteurs économiques favorables, notamment suite à la publication de résultats trimestriels positifs pour la plupart des grandes entreprises américaines. Mais malgré cette remontée quasi générale, certaines cryptomonnaies sortent encore du lot.

C'est le cas du Dogecoin (DOGE), cette cryptomonnaie créée en 2013, qui ne devait jamais être plus qu'une simple blague. Et pourtant, à l'heure de l'écriture de ces lignes, le DOGE siège à la 8e place du classement des cryptomonnaies en termes de capitalisation boursière.

Effectivement, là où le BTC et l'Ether (ETH) ont respectivement gagné 7,7 % et 21,6 %, le DOGE a surperformé le reste du marché et affiche une progression fulgurante de 111% sur la même période.

Ainsi, la désormais célèbre cryptomonnaie à l'effigie d'un Shiba Inu a pu bénéficier de l'élan général du marché, mais également de l'achat de la plateforme Twitter par Elon Musk, une acquisition qui aurait pu se régler devant les tribunaux, mais qui a finalement été finalisée cette semaine.

Effectivement, le DOGE est bien connu pour être la cryptomonnaie favorite du milliardaire, au point même qu'il soit parfois possible de l'utiliser comme moyen de paiement chez Tesla, entreprise dont Elon Musk est le PDG.

Une hausse passagère ?

Le Dogecoin a ainsi profité d'un élan tout à fait remarquable, et prouve également que son cours reste très corrélé à divers facteurs extérieurs peu prévisibles, ce qui provoque des vagues d'achat soudaines. Aussi, lorsque nous jetons un œil à l'indicateur Relative Strenght Index (RSI), nous pouvons constater que le DOGE a été largement suracheté sur la semaine.

Cours du DOGE, avec la zone de surachat délimitée au-dessus de 70 sur la partie inférieure de la capture d'écran

Bien que cela n'augure pas nécessairement une baisse de son cours aussi soudaine que sa récente hausse, cela peut au moins laisser présager une correction ou une volatilité amoindrie à court terme de ce dernier.

En parallèle d'une hausse générale du volume de trading sur le DOGE, nous pouvons également constater une hausse importante du nombre de transactions pour les whales.

Nombre de transactions sur le DOGE avec un montant supérieur à 100 000 dollars

Par conséquent, la capitalisation boursière du DOGE s'est également accrue de façon considérable. Effectivement, cette dernière dépassait tout juste les 8 milliards de dollars en début de semaine et a plus de doublé sur la semaine, jusqu'à atteindre les 19,8 milliards de dollars lors de son point le plus haut au 29 octobre. La capitalisation du DOGE a toutefois continué de grimper de plus de 17,5 % sur les dernières 24 heures.

Ainsi, le DOGE a dépassé la capitalisation boursière de Solana (SOL) et de Cardano (ADA), ce qui, encore une fois, le place à la 8e place du podium des cryptomonnaies.

Tamadoge (TAMA) has risen by 19% in the past 24 hours, reaching a price of $0.02779170. This also represents an 18.6% increase in the past week, as TAMA regains steadily from a correction after its post-listing surge.

Following its listing on OKX and other major exchanges, the price of TAMA rose to an all-time high of $0.194446 on October 4, equalling a rise of just over 700% in a week, as well as a rise of more than 1,800% compared to its presale price. Since then, negativity in the wider market dragged its price down, yet it has begun re-posting above-average gains since the weekend.

And with plenty to look forward to on Tamadoge's roadmap, it's only likely that TAMA will continue witnessing strong gains in the future.

This New Memecoin is Up 18% Today Beating Dogecoin and Shiba Inu – Time to Buy?

Running on Ethereum, Tamadoge is a meme token crossed with a play-to-earn metaverse-based game. It provides players with the chance to collect, breed, battle and trade NFT-based Tamadoge pets, something which potentially will provide them with a profit on top of entertainment.

As the chart below illustrates, TAMA is currently riding a wave of upwards momentum. Its relative strength index (purple) has jumped from 30 in the past few days to over 70 in the past few hours, indicating strong buying pressure.

At the same time, its 30-day moving average (red) is rising up towards its 200-day average (blue). A crossover (a 'golden cross') would signal a potential breakout, meaning that TAMA could rise to new longer term levels.

Of course, during turbulent market periods technical indicators can't always be trusted. Nonetheless, Tamadoge's fundamentals suggest that it has plenty of gains ahead.

First of all, it's worth pointing out just how quickly Tamadoge raised $19 million during its presale and also accumulated just shy of 80,000 followers on Twitter. Such achievements indicate a strong investor appetite for the project, while also underlining how it has already created a sizeable community for itself, something which is essential for a memecoin.

And aside from securing a number of significant exchange listings (and potentially a listing on Binance), Tamadoge is also enjoying steady development, as it moves towards the full launch of its metaverse. Most notably, it has launched a range of its non-fungible tokens, beginning with 1,000 rare NFTs earlier in October and then 20,000 common NFTs a few days ago.

These NFTs are what players will need to own in order to play Tamadoge's metaverse, which is currently under development, with the project's team also agreeing partnerships as part of the development process. On top of this, the metaverse will comprise a range of arcade games, in addition to the core Tamagotchi/Pokémon-style experience.

While no specific launch date has been provided for either the metaverse or the arcade games, they're expected to arrive early next year at some point. It's from here that the market could really see TAMA take off, with the token being used to purchase in-game items and being subject to a 5% burn on each transaction (on top of a maximum supply of two billion TAMA).

Even now, TAMA is outperforming pre-established meme tokens such as DOGE and SHIB, which are only 4% and 2% up today (respectively). This highlights the potential it has, given that it isn't even fully launched yet.

NFT Renaissance

TAMA's launch also comes at a time when, following a year-long slump, the wider NFT market has begun showing signs of rejuvenation. For example, trading volume of Reddit NFTs surpassed $2.5 million in 24 hours last week, having launched back in July.

Such signs of recovery also come as the cryptocurrency market and global stock markets begin to look a little healthier, with the Dow Jones having risen for four consecutive weeks. While the global economy does remain in a precarious condition, such rebounds could indicate the beginning of the end for the general slump we've seen this year.

If so, TAMA is better placed than most coins to post substantial gains. Not only does it have a strong and growing community of supporters, but its fundamentals mean that it's set to continue growing well into the future.

Dogecoin continued its rally on Monday reinforcing last week's buying frenzy that was triggered by Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter.

Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) outperformed all other blue-chip cryptocurrencies last week after Musk took hold of the reins of Twitter (TWTR).

Friday's finalisation of Musk's Twitter purchase was a catalyst for a memecoin breakout, with dogecoin leading the pack.

Dogecoin rose by over 104% last week, but early on Monday, the premier memecoin price dipped.

However, this was only a temporary fall as strong investor buy-in saw the price swing higher again to over $0.12.

Across multiple cryptocurrency exchanges over $4bn dogecoin short positions have now been liquidated, according to data from coinglass.com.

On Monday, veteran trader Peter Brandt warned investors to be wary of the alpha memecoin's latest rally.

He cautioned against interpreting this price explosion as the beginning of a bull market and tweeted: ""A common mistake made by novice and wannabe traders is assuming that an end to a bear phase of a market is automatically a signal that a bull market has begun.

""This assumption is most often wrong.""

Check: Crypto live prices

The comments followed an earlier tweet in which the veteran trader described last week's dogecoin price action as nudging the memecoin out of its prolonged 'bear channel'.

According to veteran trader Peter Brandt chart analysis shows that dogecoin has been in a 'bear channel' since May 2021.

On Sunday he tweeted: ""This is called a bear channel, the upside violation of which has ended the bear market that began at the May 2021 high $DOGE.""

The recent dogecoin pump has been attributed to 'the Elon effect' stemming from the Tesla CEO buying Twitter.

Musk tweeted on Friday that Twitter will form a content moderation council ""with widely diverse viewpoints"".

Last week, the Twitter-sphere was embroiled in speculation that Musk would reinstate former US president Donald Trump's Twitter account.

Story continues

However, Musk added that no major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before the council convenes.

The billionaire in a tweet on Saturday said that Twitter users could in future choose a version of the social media platform they like by providing ratings on their tweets.

He added: ""Being able to select which version of Twitter you want is probably better, much as it would be for a movie maturity rating.""

However, the Tesla boss came under fire after tweeting a link to an article with an unfounded theory about the “life-threatening” hammer attack on Paul Pelosi, the husband of US House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi.

The tweet, which he later deleted, linked to an article that made unsubstantiated claims about Paul Pelosi’s personal life and the role it may have played in last week’s attack at his and his wife’s home in San Francisco.

The article linked to in the tweet was from the Santa Monica Observer, an outlet that had previously made the outlandish claim that Hillary Clinton died on 11 September and was replaced with a body double.

Other cryptocurrencies rallied on Monday, with the entire crypto market cap ascending to $1.07 Trillion, a gain of 0.7% in the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) made a bullish move up 6.3% in the past week to $20,800, whilst ethereum (ETH-USD) also rose to $1,626, up almost 20% in the past week.

Bitcoin usually moves in correlation with equities such as the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC).

2022-10-31 10:24:54.763940,Nasdaq,Why Chainlink Was Shooting Higher on Sunday,"What happened

Sunday was hardly a day of rest for Chainlink (CRYPTO: LINK) investors, as they were busy trading up the niche cryptocurrency. As of mid-afternoon, Chainlink's price had risen by almost 4%; like a certain low-priced crypto in the very recent past, the token seems to be benefiting from an association with a high-profile individual who's involved in the digital currency realm.

So what

Chainlink is a token that anchors a network of ""oracles,"" which are node operators that provide reams of data. This is made available to other blockchains to provide data that can underpin smart contracts. A good example of this is scores and statistics from sports contests, which can be fed into smart contracts operated by online betting companies to handle wagers.

That's enough of a specialty to attract Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, now the core business unit of Alphabet. Since late 2021 he's been a strategic advisor to Chainlink Labs, the token's developer, and has become arguably the most high-profile individual proselytizing for the blockchain and its token.

Does that sound vaguely familiar?

It should, because that's analogous to the relationship between Tesla -- and now Twitter -- leader Elon Musk, who has been a longtime Dogecoin bull. Musk's association with the not-especially-useful coin recently led to a price spike as he restarted, and ultimately succeeded in, his attempt to buy Twitter. More than a few times, he talked up Dogecoin through the micro-messaging app.

Now what

As often happens in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin's price retreated very shortly after the Twitter deal was consummated.

But investors like to look for patterns, so in that light, it's not surprising they're latching on to another crypto asset backed by a respected corporate leader. It also helps that, in contrast to Dogecoin, Chainlink is a digital asset underpinning a system that actually has a solid, real-world use.

BTC/USD -0.02% Add to/Remove from Watchlist ETH/USD +1.33% Add to/Remove from Watchlist DOGE/USD -5.22% Add to/Remove from Watchlist BNB/BRL +9.06% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

BNB, DOGE, MATIC, LUNC and APT are the top 5 altcoins to watch in November.

Binance Coin’s price is positioned above the daily 9 and 20 EMA lines.

APT’s price activity could pose as buy opportunity after listing on Binance.

The top 5 altcoins to watch for November 2022 are (BNB), (DOGE), Polygon (MATIC), Luna Classic (LUNC) and Aptos (APT).

1. Binance Coin (BNB)

Binance Coin (BNB) is trading at $313.86 after gaining 3.81% over the last 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap. Its price has also strengthened against the two crypto market leaders, (BTC) and (ETH), by 2.86% and 0.67% respectively.

BNB/USDT daily chart Source: CoinMarketCap

The 9 and 20 EMA lines crossed bullishly through the course of the last week. This cross ignited a bullish pump that say BNB’s price comfortably break above the two EMA lines. Bullish flags that suggest that BNB’s price will continue to rise are the 9 EMA breaking away above the 20 EMA line and the RSI line breaking away above the RSI SMA line.

2. Dogecoin (DOGE)

DOGE’s price has risen an astounding 46.39% over the last 24 hours – taking its price to $0.132.

DOGE/USDT daily chart Source: CoinMarketCap

DOGE’s price has increased parabolically following the news this week that Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter was completed. Investors need to brace for a potential retracement which can already be seen on DOGE’s daily chart as investors will look to cash out the profit opportunity in this current bear market.

3. Polygon (MATIC)

MATIC’s price has dropped slightly over the last 24 hours to now trade at $0.9359. It has also weakened against the two crypto market leaders, BTC and ETH, by 0.97% and 2.90% respectively.

MATIC/USDT daily chart Source: CoinMarketCap

The relative position of the daily 9 and 20 EMA lines on MATIC’s daily chart suggest that MATIC’s price will soon recover to enter into a bullish move again. MATIC’s will likely look to drop to as low as the 9 EMA line for a brief break from its bullish move, before entering into another bullish move upwards.

4. Luna Classic (LUNC)

LUNC’s price stands at $0.0002362 following a 3.63% drop in price over the last 24 hours.

LUNC/USDT daily chart Source: CoinMarketCap

LUNC’s price is currently trading in a parallel price channel between $0.00038098 and $0.00022905. The first resistance level that LUNC will have to challenge is $0.00027183. Thereafter LUNC’s price will target the upper bound of the aforementioned price channel.

5. Aptos (APT)

APT is trading at $7.85 after dropping 4.48% over the last 24 hours.

APT/USDT daily chart Source: CoinMarketCap

The price of APT has been in a decline ever since the altcoin listed on Binance. The relatively flat price movement of APT may be seen as a buy opportunity for risk-averse investors and traders, which will ultimately result in APT’s price spiking.

2022-10-30 12:24:55.098938,Gulf Daily News,Tech Talk: Dogecoin surges on Elon Musk's Twitter deal,"Dogecoin surged more than 70% on Saturday, extending this week's gains after Elon Musk sealed a $44-billion deal to take over Twitter last week.

The Tesla Inc CEO, a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies, has heavily influenced prices of dogecoin and bitcoin.

Tesla started accepting dogecoin as payment for its merchandise early this year, and Musk's newly launched perfume brand can also be bought with dogecoin.

Cryptocurrency exchange Binance which has invested $500 million into Musk's buyout of Twitter, said it is brainstorming strategies on how blockchain and crypto could be helpful to Twitter.

Twitter had begun exploring ways to incorporate blockchain technology under co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey, who has been a proponent of bitcoin.

Musk tweeted this month that he is buying Twitter to create an ""everything app"".

The idea of an everything app originated in Asia with companies like WeChat, which lets users not only send messages but also make payments, shop online or hail a taxi.

Musk's tweets on dogecoin, including the one where he called it the ""people's crypto,"" have turned the once-obscure digital currency, which began as a social media joke, into a speculator's dream.

Musk who has promised to restore free speech on Twitter is being deluged with pleas and demands to reinstate accounts of banned account holders and world leaders.

He tweeted on Friday that Twitter will form a content moderation council ""with widely diverse viewpoints,"" and said no major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before the council convenes.

2022-10-31 11:24:55.112213,Decrypt,Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin: Crypto Industry Shouldn't Be 'Enthusiastically Pursuing Institutional Capital',"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin weighed in Sunday on the regulatory debate surrounding crypto, providing his thoughts on what industry rules should—and should not—include.

Regulation could make crypto more palatable to mainstream financial institutions and legitimize cryptocurrencies as an asset class. But new rules and policies could also alter the industry’s DNA, particularly as it relates to principles like censorship resistance and decentralization.

Buterin said he believes preserving the latter should be the priority.

“I don't think we should be enthusiastically pursuing large institutional capital at full speed,” he said. “Regulation that leaves the crypto space free to act internally but makes it harder for crypto projects to reach the mainstream is much less bad than regulation that intrudes on how crypto works internally.”

Basically, especially at this time, regulation that leaves the crypto space free to act internally but makes it harder for crypto projects to reach the mainstream is much less bad than regulation that intrudes on how crypto works internally. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 30, 2022

Buterin’s Twitter thread comes ten days after a controversial blog post by Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and chief executive of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, in which he outlined his regulatory vision for the industry.

Bankman-Fried subsequently capitulated to Crypto Twitter after receiving pushback on potential rules related to DeFi, such as requiring autonomous programs to comply with U.S. sanctions and making crypto websites register as a broker-dealer. He revised the post and said he will continue to do so.

Regulatory uncertainty is seen as a barrier to institutional crypto investing, according to a new Fidelity Investments survey. The Institutional Investor Digital Assets Study found that out of more than 1,000 institutional investors, 16% said a lack of clarity around regulation was an obstacle to investing in digital assets.

On the other hand, more than 8 in 10 (81%) of the institutional investors surveyed view digital assets as having a role in investment portfolios. In addition, 43% of institutional investors said they would be interested in a Bitcoin ETF.

Segments of the crypto industry have been pursuing institutional capital for almost a decade, ever since the Winklevoss twins’ initial filing for a Bitcoin ETF-like trust in 2013. While futures-based products trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Securities and Exchange Commission has dragged its feet on approving a spot-based Bitcoin ETF.

That’s not a bad thing, according to Buterin.

“I'm actually kinda happy a lot of the ETFs are getting delayed,” he said. “The ecosystem needs time to mature before we get even more attention.”

Another maybe-controversial take of mine is that I don't think we should be enthusiastically pursuing large institutional capital at full speed. I'm actually kinda happy a lot of the ETFs are getting delayed. The ecosystem needs time to mature before we get even more attention. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 30, 2022

Buterin divided the policy goals he envisions for the crypto industry into two categories: providing better protection to consumers who navigate the nascent industry, and stemming the illicit flow of cryptocurrency—which he said are not exclusive to the DeFi space.

To address the latter, Buterin is skeptical of requiring DeFi protocol front-ends to abide by Know Your Customer (KYC) standards. While such standards are used by financial institutions to prevent money laundering, fraud, and corruption, “hackers write custom code to interact with contracts,” circumventing the usual KYC barriers.

“It would annoy users but do nothing against hackers,” he said.

The ""KYC on defi frontends"" idea does not seem very pointful to me: it would annoy users but do nothing against hackers. Hackers write custom code to interact with contracts already. Exchanges are clearly a much more sensible place to do the KYC, and that's happening already. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 30, 2022

There are DeFi regulations that Buterin thinks could be more helpful, such as limits on the amount of leverage a user can trade with, transparency in code audits, and requiring “knowledge-based tests” as opposed to “plutocratic net-worth minimum rules.”

Buterin said he’s also in favor of crafting regulation in a way that allows for the further use of zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic principle that preserves privacy.

The response to the response

SBF responded to Buterin’s points, stating he thinks they “are pretty reasonable” and expressed an openness to bringing the ethereum co-founder to Washington DC in order to give nuanced input on regulation.

“I think that policymakers/regulators would find it pretty interesting to hear from @VitalikButerin,” SBF stated. “he's very different from the average person in DC, but in a kinda refreshing way—calmly and thoughtfully saying what he thinks.”

Buterin’s comments also appeared to receive an endorsement from Changpeng Zhao, founder and chief executive of Binance, another leading cryptocurrency exchange. The CEO responded to the thread with a thumbs up emoji.

Crypto investor Ryan Sean Adams gave a nod to Buterin’s entry into the debate as well, stating Buterin is welcome to share his thoughts at Bankless, a DAO and crypto media project.

Adams had delivered pointed criticism to SBF’s initial blog post, tweeting, “This absolutely sucks.”

The MOU, signed by the Thai Fintech Association (TFA) and the Hungarian Blockchain Coalition on Oct. 25, will see the two associations “share experiences, best practices and explore areas potentially beneficial for direct cooperation,” according to a Facebook post by the Embassy of Hungary in Bangkok.

TFA president Chonladet Khemarattana said that e-commerce, mobile payments, and digital currencies are growing rapidly in Thailand and that international cooperation is needed to further develop local financial technology, according to an Oct. 29 report from the Bangkok Post.

He also claimed 20% of the world’s crypto holders are in Thailand, the country placed eighth on the 2022 Global Crypto Adoption Index released in September by analytics firm Chainalysis and crypto payments company TripleA estimates almost 6.5% of the population owns cryptocurrency,

The Hungarian Blockchain Coalition was jointly created by the country’s Ministry of Innovation and Technology and the National Data and Economy Knowledge Centre in March 2022, while the Thai Fintech Association is a nonprofit founded in 2016 with the aim of representing the local financial technology industry including cryptocurrency exchanges.

The pact comes as Thailand’s central bank, along with some of the country’s commercial banks, were involved in the testing of a cross-border wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) transaction platform using distributed ledger technology in September.

The Bank of Thailand also announced in August it was looking to start a pilot of a retail CBDC by the end of 2022 at a limited scale in the private sector among roughly 10,000 users. It would test the digital currency using “cash-like activities” such as paying for goods or services.

Meanwhile, Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has enacted some restrictions on crypto this year, with it banning the use of cryptocurrencies for payments in March, saying they “could affect the stability of the financial system.”

The regulator is also cracking down on crypto lending platforms, with the SEC planning to prohibit crypto exchanges from providing or supporting digital asset depository services.

Hungary seemingly takes a similar hard stance on cryptocurrencies. In February, the governor of the Hungarian National Bank, György Matolcsy, wanted a blanket ban on all crypto trading and mining across the European Union, saying it “serviced illegal activities” and was “speculative.”","The financial technology associations for Thailand and Hungary have signed a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to support the introduction of blockchain technology to their respective financial sectors.

2022-10-31 05:24:55.127718,The Herald,The most profitable cryptocurrency to buy in 2023,"Unlike traditional investment markets such as the s&p 500 and the nasdaq, the cryptocurrency arena has emerged as a burgeoning space in recent years. this is primarily due to the extreme returns many cryptocurrencies have generated over the past few years, outperforming even the stock market and other investment vehicles renowned for their stability and reliability. some of these cryptocurrencies include bitcoin, ethereum, and ripple, which already boasts a market cap of billions of dollars and continues to grow at an unprecedented pace.

By investing in cryptocurrencies today, individuals can gain access to a class of assets that could change the landscape of investment markets forever. whether one chooses to invest a small or significant sum, there is no denying that investing in cryptocurrency offers exciting opportunities for growth and profit that simply cannot be found elsewhere.

That said, the cryptocurrency market is more volatile than other markets and can have bear markets that can wipe out significant amounts of value. for instance, the 2022 cryptocurrency bear market has wiped out more than 70% off most cryptocurrencies. the good news is that this presents an opportunity to profit even more once the market rebounds.

If you want to maximize returns, here is the most profitable cryptocurrency to buy today.

A closer look at the most profitable cryptocurrencies to buy in 2023

The entire cryptocurrency is trading at massive lows. from a market capitalisation of close to $3 trillion towards the end of 2021, it is now hovering around $900 billion. Interestingly, most cryptocurrencies have experienced increased adoption and improved technical fundamentals despite dropping prices.

Anyone who chooses to buy cryptocurrencies at current prices could get a good return in 2023.

Below, we take an in-depth look at the top profitable cryptocurrencies to invest in 2023. Each has lots of potential due to a heavy price discount and fast-growing fundamentals.

Shiba inu

Shiba inu is a top meme coin that easily stands out as a profitable cryptocurrency to invest in.

Shiba inu entered the market in late 2020 and was designed to capitalise on the growing popularity of dogecoin and other meme coins. Though its creators initially conceived of it simply as a joke, shiba inu has continued to surprise and impress investors with its steady gains over the past year. It was one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in 2021, with gains of over 40 million per cent.

And with momentum on its side, shiba inu shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. For instance, the shiba inu team has launched a layer-2 solution to make shib scale better, a metaverse, and pay and burn feature to cut down on the number of tokens in circulation.

With these developments, a growing community and shiba inu is trading at a massive discount from its most recent highs. This is coupled with the fact that shiba inu is now available on most top cryptocurrency exchanges like etoro. in another rally, shiba inu stands out as a highly profitable cryptocurrency to buy in 2023.

Virtual currencies are highly volatile.Your capital is at risk.

Chainlink

Chainlink is one of the most obvious inclusions in the list of top-performing cryptocurrencies to buy in 2023. That's because, in terms of its fundamentals, chainlink ranks among the top leading cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum. chainlink has a lot of similarities to bitcoin that give it a high potential to go up in value long term.

For instance, just like bitcoin, chainlink has market dominance. While bitcoin dominates the entire market, chainlink has built dominance in the decentralised oracles market. It controls more than 60 per cent of this market, and almost all the major smart contract chains use chainlink data oracles for their smart contracts. This means there is very little chance that chainlink will ever lose its market dominance.

The odds are that chainlink is hugely undervalued at current prices thanks to such strong fundamentals. Since it made all-time highs in 2021, chainlink has lost a significant portion of its value – more than 75 per cent off its most recent all-time highs.

Going into 2023, chainlink has a good chance of being a profitable cryptocurrency for exponential gains due to the upcoming staking feature. While it has not yet been introduced, there is speculation that chainlink staking will become a thing soon. Once it is introduced, we could see the number of people who opt to buy chainlink increase in anticipation of the passive income that will come with staking. Essentially, a lot going on could see chainlink emerge as one of the top cryptocurrency performers. The odds favour link.

Sandbox

The metaverse is growing, and sandbox is one of the top metaverse cryptocurrencies in the market today. This makes it an easy pick for the top profitable cryptocurrency to invest in 2023. Sandbox has a lot going for it, making it a good metaverse cryptocurrency to buy.

For instance, there is growing adoption of the sandbox relative to most other metaverse cryptocurrencies. For instance, in 2022, sandbox inked a deal with warner music for virtual concerts to start taking place on the sandbox metaverse. At the same time, top musicians have started performing on the sandbox metaverse, including Snoop Dogg.

With such high-profile adoption, sandbox will likely draw more money relative to other metaverse cryptocurrencies going into the future. Sandbox and other top cryptocurrencies also stand to benefit from the fact that governments are increasingly making regulations and investments that favour this market.

For instance, the governments of South Korea and Japan have made considerable investments to ensure that the metaverse takes off in their countries. This means there is a lot of hope for cryptocurrencies like sandbox to do well going into the future.

The best part is that sandbox is currently trading at a huge discount from its all-time highs in 2021. If it retests its most recent all-time highs, sandbox would give investors an roi of over 200 per cent. This would make it one of the top most profitable cryptocurrencies to buy today.

While there are no guarantees in the cryptocurrency market, the odds clearly favor sandbox in the short to medium term.

Cardano

Cardano is one of the most technically advanced cryptocurrencies in the market today. As such, it stands out as a profitable cryptocurrency to invest in right now.

One of the key factors that makes cardano a good cryptocurrency to buy is that its proof-of-stake algorithm is one of the best in the market. Even ethereum, which recently transitioned to proof-of-stake, can't match cardano in terms of efficiency.

Cardano's proof-of-stake algorithm is decentralised, scalable, and secure. it can maintain a balance between these three key aspects of the blockchain even as network adoption grows.

Besides its technical capabilities, cardano adoption points to a cryptocurrency that is on a growth trajectory. for instance, since the introduction of cardano smart contracts back in 2021, network adoption has grown. Even metaverse projects are now building on cardano. This is a pointer to the long-term growth of cardano in the long run.

At the same time, cardano's price prediction action points to a potential for growth in the short to medium term. That's because cardano is currently trading at massive lows, off more than 70 per cent its most recent high, and is currently trading at under $0.50. If cardano were to retest all-time highs again, then cardano would give investors a return of over 200 per cent.

Avalanche

Avalanche stands out among the top-performing cryptocurrencies to buy today. Avalanche makes it to this list for its capabilities as a stable and highly scalable platform blockchain.

Thanks to its abilities, avalanche now has one of the fastest ecosystems of projects building on top of it. From defi to nfts, avalanche has emerged as one of the most credible defi cryptocurrencies in the market today.

Besides its growing strengths as an ethereum competitor in the smart contracts market, avalanche is currently trading at record lows from its 2021 highs. Avalanche is trading at under $20, down from highs of over $100 back in 2021.

This means if avalanche were to just return to its all-time highs, it would give investors a return of over 300 per cent from its most recent highs. This is a potentially high return and from a cryptocurrency that also has some pretty good prospects long term.

Polygon

Next on the list of top most profitable cryptocurrencies to buy and hold is polygon. Polygon is the largest ethereum layer-2 chain and already has a large and fast-growing ecosystem of cryptocurrencies building on top of it.

Besides its position as a top ethereum layer-2, polygon's tokenomics make it a top profitable cryptocurrency to buy now. Since mid-2022, polygon has become deflationary, which means the more it is adopted, demand will drive up the price due to the basic economics of demand and supply.

Even with all these fundamentals in favor of polygon's growth, polygon is currently trading at a significant discount compared to its 2021 highs. At its current price, polygon has the potential to give investors a return of over 200 per cent if it retests its most recent all-time highs.

With the odds that the cryptocurrency market could now be trading at the bottom or is very close to it, polygon's potential value in 2023 is pretty high. You will also love that polygon is available on almost all top cryptocurrency exchanges, including etoro.

>>>Buy cryptos now<<<

Virtual currencies are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk.

Cosmos

Next in the list of top cryptocurrencies to invest in right now is cosmos. Cosmos entered the market in 2019 to solve the problem of blockchain interoperability. This concept refers to the ability of two or more blockchains to communicate and share data, even though their underlying networks utilise different coding languages and consensus algorithms.

By enabling interoperability between a wide range of blockchains, cosmos has revolutionised the way we think about distributed systems and peer-to-peer networks. Their ultimate vision is one where any blockchain can interoperate with any other blockchain to support new use cases and create innovative applications.

Whether you are a developer looking for an easier way to integrate blockchain into your projects or someone interested in learning more about this emerging technology, cosmos is sure to be at the forefront of your mind. With its roots firmly planted in innovation and progress, this platform will undoubtedly pave new paths on the road ahead for many years to come.

Cosmos has the potential to open up new avenues for collaboration, paving the way for the development of what some have dubbed web 3.0 – an interconnected web of decentralised online services underpinned by blockchain technology. whether or not cosmos ultimately succeeds in this ambitious endeavor remains to be seen, but it has already sparked much excitement within the blockchain community, heralding a powerful shift in how we think about data sharing and exchange.

Currently, cosmos is trading at more than 70 per cent off its recent all-time highs. With adoption on a growth trajectory, the odds are that cosmos value will increase over time, especially if bulls return to the market. This makes cosmos one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy and hold with a potential for exponential gains.

Ethereum – platform blockchain with massive potential due to improving fundamentals

There are many options to choose from when it comes to investing in cryptocurrencies. Some are still in the early stages of development, while others have already established themselves as industry leaders. One cryptocurrency that is well-established yet still holds impressive growth potential is ethereum.

Not only does this digital currency currently boast a multi-billion-dollar market capitalisation, but its value has continued to rise steadily in recent years. To understand why ethereum is a profitable cryptocurrency to buy, consider its price action since its launch. When ethereum conducted an initial coin offering (ico) back in 2014, it was selling at under a dollar. Today, it is worth over $1000, meaning that anyone who invested at that time could have seen a several hundred percent return on their investment today.

With the recent shift to proof-of-stake, ethereum is a good buy today as it is set to gain even more traction. That's because ethereum is now deflationary and is set to scale even better and with a lower impact on the environment. So now might be the perfect time to get involved with ethereum, as it has what it takes to be one of the most profitable cryptocurrencies to buy in 2023.

To get an idea of how good of an investment ethereum is today, consider that it seems to have found support at the $1000 level. This means if it were to raise in 2023 and retest it's all-time highs, ethereum price prediction could give investors a return of over 200 per cent.

Dogecoin – number one meme coin with a fast-growing community.

Hype is one of the biggest factors regarding cryptocurrency value appreciation. This was most evident during the 2021 bull market when the most hype cryptocurrencies were the best performers. For this reason, dogecoin makes it to the list of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in 2023.

Dogecoin was launched at a time when the concept of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology were just beginning to gain mainstream recognition. Launched in early 2013, dogecoin quickly became one of the most established tokens in this rapidly growing market. At its launch, dogecoin was trading for just $0.0002 per token, but this soon skyrocketed as its popularity grew and more people began to take an interest in this groundbreaking new technology.

The rise of dogecoin would not have been possible without the support of elon musk. As CEO of Tesla, Musk is known for his forward-thinking ideas about technology and business. In early 2021, he expressed his admiration for dogecoin through positive tweets about the project. These tweets not only sparked a wave of new interest in this cryptocurrency, but also prompted speculation that Musk himself might be involved with the development of dogecoin or other related projects. Whatever the case may be, this endorsement from such a powerful figure helped to solidify dogecoin's place as one of the most prominent cryptocurrencies on the market. Thanks to this combination of longevity and enthusiastic support from influential figures like Musk, dogecoin continues to prosper today and seems poised for continued success well into the future.

The Musk effect was so high that by May 2021, dogecoin was trading at $0.77. while Musk may not be such an influential figure on dogecoin anymore, his tweets opened dogecoin to more adoption and community growth.

Now that dogecoin is over 80 per cent off its 2021 highs, this large and growing community could see dogecoin rally in 2023. If dogecoin rallies from its current price, it could easily do 4x from its current price. That's why it stands out among the top most profitable cryptocurrencies.

Defi coin – new high-growth defi cryptocurrency with high yields and token swaps.

Decentralised finance is on a growth trajectory despite the slump in cryptocurrency prices in 2022. For this reason, next-gen defi cryptocurrencies like defi coin are in a unique place for growth going into the future. That's why at current prices, defi coin makes it to the list of most profitable cryptocurrencies to buy in 2023.

Defi coin is taking the defi market by storm. Led by a highly qualified and experienced team of developers, defi is focused on creating an innovative platform that is fully secure and reliable in all areas.

One exciting development for defi coin is the upcoming launch of the defi swap exchange. The team behind this innovative platform has been working tirelessly on the final stages of its development, and it looks like everything is on target for a seamless launch. With defi swap, users can buy and sell tokens without going through a third party or opening an account. Furthermore, transactions are carried out anonymously using smart contracts, which ensure timely, secure execution of all trades. given these features, now could be a good time to buy defi coin before defi swap officially launches.

Besides being a relatively new cryptocurrency, defi coin is likely to keep drawing in investors looking for exponential gains once the markets gain traction. New cryptocurrencies tend to do well when fomo hits the market, which means defi coin stands out as one of the top profitable cryptocurrencies to invest in 2023.

Bitcoin – most adopted cryptocurrency with huge potential as supply dwindles.

Bitcoin is one of the market's most stable and profitable cryptocurrencies today. Despite multiple bull and bear cycles, a smoothed curve for bitcoin shows that it has been on an upward trajectory since it launched.

When bitcoin was first introduced in 2009, very few people knew about cryptographic currencies. This gave early investors a chance to buy bitcoin at extremely low prices. It was relatively easy to obtain bitcoin simply by connecting a basic gpu to your desktop computer.

Things have changed over the years though. By late 2021, bitcoin was trading highs of $69k. However, following bitcoin's high point in late 2021, its value dropped significantly to lows near $19,000. Despite this fluctuation, however, there is no doubt that the unprecedented growth witnessed by bitcoin since its inception is a powerful testament to the compelling nature of this emerging technology.

At current prices, even if bitcoin were just to retest its most recent highs, it would give investors an incredible return on investment. Potentially up to 2x its current value.

The indicators are that bitcoin is a top cryptocurrency to consider adding to your watchlists in 2023. For starters, adoption is on a growth trajectory. For instance, despite the bear market, the number of institutional investors taking up bitcoin is on a growth trajectory. Given that bitcoin has a hard-capped supply of only 21 million coins, this growing investment signals bitcoin's viability as a cryptocurrency to buy.

Decentraland – metaverse cryptocurrency with a fast-growing gaming ecosystem

Decentraland is one of the best metaverse cryptocurrencies in the market today. This means that having dropped more than 70 per cent off its most recent all-time highs, there is a huge opportunity for gains.

Decentraland is a virtual world unlike any other. Built on top of the ethereum blockchain, it allows users to freely explore its vast expanse, commune with other residents, and interact with an infinite array of digital content. Unlike many other virtual worlds, decentraland holds tremendous potential for developers who want to build immersive 3d experiences.

As a decentralised platform that places content ownership in the hands of users, decentraland enables creators to easily deploy dynamic and interactive digital spaces that seamlessly blend the physical and digital worlds. With thousands of prospects for innovation and limitless opportunities for interaction and enrichment, decentraland presents a bold glimpse into the future of the metaverse.

The best part is that users' virtual assets on the decentraland can be sold as nfts. Users can then store nfts in a cryptocurrency exchange of their choice or sell them. With nfts expected to gain traction going into the future, decentraland stands out as a top cryptocurrency to invest in.

How we identify profitable cryptocurrencies to invest in today

Since the bear market began, most cryptocurrencies have lost significant value and seen widespread price fluctuations. While this may seem scary to many investors, it is important to remember that these fluctuations are normal in the volatile world of cryptos. That's why deciding on potentially profitable cryptocurrencies to invest in can be a challenging endeavor. Many factors must be considered, including a cryptocurrency's technical foundations, potential use cases, and long-term viability.

Additionally, investors must often navigate confusing or contradictory information from nascent crypto communities and must stay up-to-date with the latest developments in this rapidly evolving market. Ultimately, successfully navigating through all of these challenges will require patience and a deep understanding of the cryptocurrency space as a whole. But for those who can successfully navigate these rough waters, investing in good crypto projects has the potential to yield tremendous rewards.

You don't have to worry though. In the section below, we take through the procedure we have taken to choose the most profitable cryptocurrency to invest in 2023. You can use the same techniques to choose high-potential cryptocurrencies you can invest in going into the future.

Consider the idea behind the cryptocurrency and its roadmap

When looking for the best cryptocurrency to invest in, one of the most important factors is the underlying concept and vision behind the project. This includes not only understanding what problem the project aims to address, but also evaluating how realistic its goals and targets are. A good indicator of a promising project is a clear, well-developed roadmap outlining specific goals that are designed to be achieved within a set period.

Another critical step is to thoroughly research the technical details of each potential investment, as this can help determine which projects have strong development teams with significant experience in blockchain technology. In short, when searching for the most profitable cryptocurrency, it is crucial to go beyond simple token performance metrics and look at everything from concept and roadmap targets to technological viability and team experience.

For instance, ethereum has been such a huge success because the idea of creating a decentralised world computer was powerful. Similarly, if you use the same approach to scout for cryptocurrencies, you are likely to find a profitable cryptocurrency to buy in 2023.

Look for hugely undervalued and fundamentally strong cryptocurrencies

One of the best ways to find profitable cryptocurrencies is to look for fundamentally strong cryptocurrencies that have seen a huge drop in valuation. During market downturns like the one we are experiencing now, many cryptocurrencies lose significant value as investors bail out and cash out their positions.

By looking for promising coins that have experienced significant losses, you can often get in on these projects at discounted rates and potentially reap big gains when their valuations eventually rise again. Some key factors to consider when researching potential investments include the project's active development community, future roadmap milestones, and overall popularity among crypto enthusiasts. With time, patience, and a bit of luck, choosing good picks from the sea of struggling cryptocurrencies could lead to profitability.

For instance, bitcoin is without a doubt one of the fundamentally strongest cryptocurrencies in the market today. An investor can record huge profits by capitalising on its ups and downs. After the crash of 2018, bitcoin dropped from over $20k to a low of $3000. Investors that capitalised on this dip benefited immensely when bitcoin hit a high of $69,000 in 2021.

Similarly, by buying bitcoin at its current lows of under $20k, it could emerge as a top profitable cryptocurrency in 2023, even by just retesting its most recent highs.

Consider the token distribution

There is no denying the fact that investing in cryptocurrency can be a profitable venture. However, finding the right coin to invest in isn't always easy. One effective way to identify profitable cryptocurrencies is to assess the number of people who hold the token in question. A high holder count indicates that many people have an interest in that particular coin and its potential for growth. Therefore, by focusing on tokens with high holder counts, investors can increase their chances of finding profitable investments and outperforming the market as a whole.

In most cases, cryptocurrencies, where all the coins are concentrated in only a few wallets, tend to be pump-and-dump schemes or even outright scams. That's because the few accounts that hold all the tokens have a lot of influence on what happens to the cryptocurrency.

Consider its price action in previous bear markets

Many of the most popular cryptocurrencies today are relatively new, having launched in the past few years. These up-and-coming projects tend to experience rapid growth in price and user base, but they also face an increased risk of adversely affecting a bear market.

On the other hand, older cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, dogecoin, and ethereum have already endured multiple bear markets to date, making them somewhat more resilient to total collapse even after market downturns. By virtue of their longevity and proven track record, these cryptocurrencies may be considered less risky investments and thus better positioned for long-term growth.

Furthermore, their numerous use cases and strong community support also recommend them as solid investment opportunities for those looking to capitalise on the continued momentum of this exciting new technology. in short, while new cryptocurrencies may offer higher returns in good times, experienced projects like bitcoin offer greater stability in the long run.

As such, if you are looking for a profitable cryptocurrency to invest in right now that is also relatively safe, it is important to consider past price action.

When is the best time to buy profitable cryptocurrencies?

Buy during bear markets

When it comes to investing in cryptocurrencies, timing is everything. During extended bear market conditions, some of the best opportunities to buy can be found in top digital currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum. These tokens often trade at steeply discounted prices during these downtrends, and those that bought in early have been able to enjoy enormous profits when prices eventually recover.

Additionally, major regulatory developments tend to occur during these times of uncertainty, which creates new opportunities for investors who are poised and ready to take action. So, if you're looking for profitable cryptocurrencies to buy in 2023, the current bear market conditions are the perfect time to start buying.

As long as you stay calm, patient, and strategic with your investments, there's no reason why you can't profit from this exciting and ever-changing market explosion.

Buy during presales

There are many different strategies for buying cryptocurrencies, and one of the most effective is participating in the presale of a new token. Unlike buying during a coin's public offering, where prices may be driven up by speculation and hype, participating in a project's presale typically offers a much more favorable price point. This is because investors who buy during the presale are taking on greater risk since they are helping the team raise the capital they need to launch their project.

In addition, those who buy early often have the opportunity to earn bonus tokens or extra rewards if they agree to lock their investment into their wallet for some time after the sale has concluded. Overall, purchasing coins during a project's presale can be an excellent way to invest in promising cryptocurrencies and potentially reap great returns over time.

Just to give you an idea of how big presales can be, consider that in its ico, ethereum was trading at $0.30. Ethereum has since become one of the most profitable cryptocurrencies ever, even hitting a high of $4800 in 2022.

Risk appetite notably improved this past week on Wall Street. Dow Jones futures lead the charge, surging 5.89% to the highest since late August. Meanwhile, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 2.62% and 3.32%, respectively. In Europe, the FTSE 100 and DAX 40 gained 1.12% and 4.03%, respectively. Australia’s ASX 200 climbed 1.63%.

Overall, a solid earnings season helped propel sentiment higher this past week. Certain big-tech companies, such as Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet, charged higher. There was some volatility as Meta’s stock fell as much as 25% following dismal earnings. Meanwhile, Caterpillar Inc. saw earnings surprise higher on strong parts demand.

Meanwhile, Fed moderation bets gained traction, cooling the US Dollar. In the week ahead, all eyes turn to the US central bank as it likely delivers another jumbo 75-basis point rate hike on Wednesday. That would bring benchmark lending rates to 4%. More attention will be placed on their guidance going forward as the pace of tightening is seen slowing.

Outside of the Fed, AUD/USD will be eyeing a much less aggressive rate hike from the Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday. This is as the British Pound eyes a potential 75-basis point rate hike from the Bank of England on Thursday. Then, markets will shift focus on US non-farm payrolls data on Friday. Will a slowing labor market offer markets some optimism?

Other notable economic prints include New Zealand’s jobs report for NZD/USD. Chinese manufacturing PMI will reveal how the world’s second-largest economy is faring amid slowing global growth. Earnings season is also still in play, with companies such as Moderna, Uber and Toyota reporting. As such, another busy week is in store.

Data from CoinMarketCap showed that the cryptocurrency market turned green last week, ending a series of sideways trading that lasted nearly 3 weeks.

Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest coin, made a stronger rally. The coin skyrocketed nearly 5% in 24 hours and over 21% in 7 days, rising from $1,350 to $1,583 – ETH’s highest price since Sept. 15, the Merge date. ETH’s inflation rate has decreased sharply post-Merge.

This strengthens people’s belief in the upward momentum of the coin in the future.

Other coins are also increasing. Top 20 altcoins have reportedly gained 5% to 18% in the last 24 hours. The most impressive performance went to Dogecoin (DOGE) with a 18% increase.

The Bank is Spending

There is no substantial news to support the cryptocurrency market’s robust recovery. However, the reason for Dogecoin’s incredible performance could be linked to Elon Musk’s recent contract with Twitter.

After a series of negotiations between the two parties, the billionaire successfully became the new chief of the social network in a $44 billion deal.

According to The New York Times, Elon Musk initiated his clean-up campaign soon after the new ownership took over. Twitter’s new CEO sacked four senior executives: CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal, Chief Legal and Policy Officer Vijaya Gadde, and General Counsel Sean Edgett.

Despite a prolonged stretch of gloomy days in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin (BTC) is becoming a more stable asset than US stocks.

However, it is crucial to realize that the Bitcoin retracement phenomenon is not new. The crypto market and traditional finance are both facing new challenges as they prepare for a slew of macroeconomic data from the United States.

Key Macro Events Are Underway

The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index rose 5.1% in September, compared with an estimate of 5.2%. This trend, like the CPI, is a downward trend and has verified that inflation spreads across sectors, not just one commodity.

Many technology behemoths, including Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook), Apple, and Amazon, released their third-quarter earnings reports this week. Google shares plummeted substantially on October 26 after the company announced poor business performance in the fall.

The focus will obviously be on the Fed’s announcement of rate hikes on November 3, with economists predicting another 0.75% increase. The Federal Reserve boosted interest rates from 0.25% to 3% in 2022, the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis.

The U.S. central bank won’t pause its rally until inflation falls to about half its current level. The strongest tightening cycle in decades has brought greater recession risks than ever before. The Fed will have another rate adjustment in December.

Recently, it was reported that Federal Reserve officials agreed to raise interest rates by 0.75% in November, but would consider a lower hike in December after seeing the negative impact of rate adjustments on the economy.

On November 11, the United States will report October inflation figures. The revelation will undoubtedly cause Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market to fluctuate.

Investors are examining the risks as the Fed considers tightening the market in reaction to inflation, implying that the likelihood of pumping money into the market is lower this year. The market is struggling to attract new investors as the situation worsens.

On the other side, the industry is increasingly being scrutinized by regulators. Seems a little late.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has specifically increased its efforts in response to recent occurrences in the cryptocurrency market and bankruptcy filed by some of the top bitcoin lenders.

Doge’s competitor Shiba Inu also pumped nearly 25% during the weekend signaling that good days could return to the crypto markets.

2022-10-31 09:24:55.449386,Yahoo Finance,Elon Musk refutes Twitter layoff timing to affect year-end compensation,"Elon Musk, Chief Twit, has refuted claims from a New York Times report this weekend that states he plans to lay off employees before Tuesday, November 1, thus cutting staff off from receiving stock grants as part of their compensation.

In response to a tweet from Eric Umansky, deputy managing editor of ProPublica, that said Musk was ""making sure to fire people at Twitter before part of their year-end compensation kicks in on Tuesday,"" Musk said: ""This is false."" He didn't provide any clarification about what, specifically, was false.

This content is not available due to your privacy preferences. Update your settings here to see it.

Umansky's tweet included a screenshot of a highlighted portion of the NYT story that also noted stock grants make up a significant portion of an employee's pay, and by laying off workers before that date, Musk may avoid paying the grants.

Musk did not respond to TechCrunch's request for clarification on whether the layoffs will affect stock compensation. He may very well have been refuting the entire NYT article, which stated Musk is said to have ordered job cuts across the company, citing ""four people with knowledge of the matter."" But that seems unlikely, given the layoffs that are already underway.

Previous reports said Musk would layoff 75% of Twitter's staff, but last week when the executive visited Twitter headquarters, he said those numbers weren't correct. Still, reports have been surfacing about various layoffs at the social media company, including of top Twitter executives like CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal, General Counsel Sean Edgett and Head of Legal Policy, Trust and Safety Vijaya Gadde.

Musk's $44 billion deal to purchase Twitter went through late on Thursday last week. The New York Stock Exchange stopped trading Twitter's stock on Friday morning, where it had been listed since 2013. Twitter will officially be delisted from the stock exchange on November 8.

Current shareholders will be paid $54.20, Musks's buying price, per share. It's not clear how Twitter's now-private status will affect current employees with stock grants.","In response to a tweet from Eric Umansky, deputy managing editor of ProPublica, that said Musk was ""making sure to fire people at Twitter before part of their year-end compensation kicks in on Tuesday,"" Musk said: ""This is false.""

But not before some US$52mln in short positions were liquidated on the exchanges.

With a market capitalisation of over US$15bn, the meme coin remains extremely overbought, making further retracement likely.

BTC/USD -0.02% Add to/Remove from Watchlist DOGE/USD -5.21% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Altcoins are currently presenting better trade opportunities than (BTC).

A good technical indicator to identify short-term trade opportunities is the 1W SMMA 7.

TORN, LINK and RUNE present scalp trading opportunities.

With the current situation in the crypto market, altcoins pose better trade opportunities than the crypto market leader, Bitcoin (BTC). However, not all altcoins are good opportunities for trades, as their order books are thin and their available liquidity is near zero.

Ideally, investors want to catch and trade outliers such as (DOGE), which has had an influx of volume over the last week to earn it the top-performing crypto asset title last week.

A good technical indicator to use when trying to determine which altcoins to trade is the 1W SMMA 7, which will also assist in identifying short-term trade opportunities.

Weekly chart for TORN/USDT (Source: TradingView)

TORN may be a good short opportunity seeing that it has already spiked for liquidity 2-3 weeks ago. With this being the case, it won’t pump to the level it reached after the spike again in the short term. When looking at the weekly chart for TORN, it’s likely to print lower lows in the weeks that will follow.

Weekly chart for LINK/USDT (Source: TradingView)

Looking at the weekly chart for LINK, its price was able to hold its lows and enter into a long consolidation. The 1W SMMA is flat and the price is trading around it. As a result, LINK is likely to pump to the 1D 200 MA, which may be a good trade opportunity.

Weekly chart for RUNE/USDT (Source: TradingView)

RUNE was able to hold its low on its weekly chart. Thereafter it entered into a multi-week consolidation, and traders haven’t grabbed the liquidity from the upside yet. With this being the case, RUNE could provide a nice short-term scalp up to around 1W 7 SMMA.

2022-10-31 10:24:55.477096,CNBC,The fear of missing out can be a killer for investors. Here's how top-ranked financial advisors keep it at bay,"Michael H | Digitalvision | Getty Images

The fear of missing out, or FOMO, can be a powerful psychological force — and it may lead unwary investors to lose bundles of money, according to financial advisors. A group of British psychologists defined FOMO as a fear ""that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent."" Financial advisor Josh Brown uses the term ""animal spirits"" to describe the concept of investors allowing their emotions to guide them. These days, social media platforms are a big source of FOMO, bombarding users with messages about ""hot"" investments such as cryptocurrency, meme stocks and special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. The influencers and experts touting such assets claim buyers can earn bundles of money, but they may gloss over the risks or fail to disclose their own motivations.

This isn't to say flavor-of-the-day investments always turn out to be flops for buyers, depending on when they buy and sell. Problem is: Investors often only hear about the big winners, not the duds, advisors and experts said. Controlling FOMO ""is probably the most important financial skill these days, in the social media era,"" Morgan Housel, author of ""The Psychology of Money,"" said in September at the Future Proof wealth conference in Huntington Beach, California.

'People try to hit the home run'

It's generally more prudent to ""get rich slowly,"" since investments that offer huge growth potential also tend to carry more risk and therefore bigger odds of loss, said Joseph Bert, a certified financial planner who serves as chairman and CEO of Certified Financial Group. ""People try to hit the home run, which is like [winning] the lottery in investing,"" said Bert, whose firm, based in Altamonte Springs, Florida, ranked No. 95 on the 2022 CNBC Financial Advisor 100 list. It was relatively easy for investors to make money in 2021, a year when most asset classes seemed to head nowhere but up. Strong stock and crypto gains minted a million new millionaires. Various hype-men and -women and social media communities helped nudge investors to buy in last year. For example, bitcoin prices could soar by 20% or more in a day following a single tweet from Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk; one February 2021 tweet imbued dogecoin, another cryptocurrency, with a sort of everyman quality, calling it ""the people's crypto.""

How advisors overcome investors' FOMO

Playing off that future regret is how top financial advisors try to dissuade investors from succumbing to FOMO. If a client wants to shift a lot of money into a ""FOMO asset,"" said Aldo Vultaggio, chief investment officer at Capstone Financial Advisors, he likes to discuss with them their probability of success reaching certain financial goals with and without those assets. The firm, based in Downers Grove, Illinois, ranked No. 77 on CNBC's Financial Advisor 100 list. In other words, if a client is already on pace to have enough money to retire comfortably or to afford a kid's college education, why take more risk? The fear of future failure helps dissuade clients from making the short-term investment — or at least reduce their overall allocation to it.","Michael H | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, can be a powerful psychological force — and it may lead unwary investors to lose bundles of money, according to financial advisors.

Binance Coin (BNB) has surpassed the $300 mark after its price surge over the week. The token was trading at around $274 per coin last Thursday and even threatened to fall lower as the week progressed. However, Tuesday saw the coin recover, adding around 5% profit to trade at $289. It has been smooth sailing from then onward for BNB as it continues to climb higher in value. As of writing this article, BNB is currently trading at $313. BNB’s $300-mark breakthrough comes at the same time popular meme coin Dogecoin adds over 90% value in a week. BNB is currently ranked the 4th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Related Reading: Litecoin Price Revisits $56, What Is Next For The Bulls? BNB Soars As the Overall Crypto Market Recovers The cryptocurrency market has seen a significant recovery this October. After several bearish weeks, the entire crypto market broke through its $1 trillion market-cap barrier earlier this week. This move acted as a catalyst for many cryptocurrencies to see massive gains. One such example is Binance Coin which surged more than 5% on Tuesday alone. It continued to rise throughout the week, adding a total of 15% to its value. Binance coin had it rough on October 6th when the entire crypto market started a correction phase. Before the start of the correction, BNB was at $296 and on the verge of testing the $300 mark. However, it never got to that point as the bears took over, pushing the coin to a one-month low of $257. BNB’s path to recovery was slow, with fluctuations in value between $266-$276. On Tuesday, we saw BNB break out of its consolidation range. It finally broke through the $300 mark yesterday and set a new monthly high of $318 today. Now, BNB is up nearly 5% against Bitcoin, and it seems like it will continue to grow as long as the overall market recovers.

🏛️What The Analysts Are Saying…🏛️

“It is critical that policymakers…prepare for a slowdown in demand as the lagged impact of rising interest rates and inflation begins to exert a powerful downward pull on economic activity.” — Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US

“Trulieve, like other MSOs, is pointing to Sep qtr trends running below what may have been highlighted in the 2Q call in early August.” — Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Pablo Zuanic

“We’ve been told time and again that the Fed would continue to raise rates aggressively until it sees ‘compelling’ evidence that inflation is slowing down. I don’t think the data so far meets that standard.” — Nancy Vanden Houten, US economist at Oxford Economics

👀What We’re Watching👀

• The Federal Reserve will meet on November 1-2 to determine interest rate policy. Goldman Sachs Group economists said the Fed could raise the Fed Funds rate by 75 basis points this week, followed by another 50 basis points in December and 25 basis points in February and March.

At this point, there’s no reason to believe that the Fed will ratchet down the hawkish post-decision commentary. The Fed has not indicated any ease-up in rate hiking intentions yet. Although stocks have repeatedly rebounded from lows on anticipation the Fed will slam on the brakes, it has yet to do so. Therefore, we expect the market to show possible short-term upside is the Fed goes dovish on the commentary.

• U.S, cannabis earnings season fires up once more. With revenue growth expected to remain flat—or even slightly down for select tier-1 MSOS—we don’t expect an upside surprise this week.

2022-10-31 09:24:55.515905,Royals Blue,Dogecoin jumps more than 50% as Twitter introduces “NFT Tweet Tiles” update,"Data from CoinMarketCap shows that dogecoin, the most popular memecoin, has risen by 50% over the past day. The price spike coincides with Twitter’s recent announcement of another advance in the non-fungible token (NFT) market.

Currently, DOGE is trading at about $0.14, according to statistics provided by CMC. The most popular memecoin, which is backed by Tesla CEO and billionaire Elon Musk, has risen 50% in the last 24 hours and over 143% in the last seven days, reaching a 10-week high. It is essential to remember that on October 18, Dogecoin’s hash rate reached a seven-month high of 815 TerraHashes per second (TH/S).

Twitter Tiles NFT Tweet

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently acquired Twitter for $44 billion. Twitter has developed numerous crypto-currency announcements over the past week as the deal draws closer. On Thursday, Twitter announced the testing of “NFT Tweet Tiles“.

According to the micro-blogging site, the platform plans to launch a brand new feature called “NFT Tweet Tiles“, which is a separate panel in a tweet that displays non-fungible tokens (NFT) and markets that list the particular NFT shared. This new concept of non-fungible tokens should be implemented very soon, in order to have a “impact on the tweet experience“, Twitter developers said on October 27.

Now testing: NFT Tweet Tiles 🚀 Some links to NFTs on @rarible, @MagicEden, @dapperlabs and @Jumptradenft will now show you a larger picture of the NFT alongside details like the title and creator. One more step in our journey to let developers impact the Tweet experience. pic.twitter.com/AkBisciB1i – Twitter Dev (@TwitterDev) October 27, 2022

This development comes just four days after the famous tech influencer, Jane Manchun Wong, revealed that “Twitter is working on a prototype wallet that supports the deposit and withdrawal of crypto-currencies.“

Twitter’s hexagonal logo and NFT verification method appear to be extended by the company’s new NFT Tweet tiles. NFT sales have dropped significantly over the past 12 months, with 30-day statistics showing a 22.01% drop from the previous month. The previous month, $423.91 million worth of NFT sales were settled, and total historical sales crossed the $40 billion mark this month.","Twitter Tiles NFT TweetTesla CEO Elon Musk recently acquired Twitter for $44 billion.

2022-10-31 05:24:55.841438,Yahoo Finance,Fortune favors the brave? One year on from Crypto.com’s ad with Matt Damon,"Trading volumes on popular Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com have fallen about 90% in the 12 months since the company’s “fortune favors the brave” advertisement featuring movie star Matt Damon first aired, according to data from CoinGecko.

See related article: LA’s Staples Center to be renamed Crypto.com Arena

The crypto exchange recorded US$3.2 billion in seven-day average trading volume on Nov 1, 2021, but that had fallen to US$372 million as of Oct. 30, 2022. Though the ad may have initially given the platform a boost, as it reached a high of US$5.9 billion in early December.



The ad, which ostensibly encouraged users to invest in cryptocurrency by suggesting they should not miss out on an opportunity to be an early investor, first aired in late October 2021 near the height of that year’s crypto market bull run. It was seen by many at the time as the moment cryptocurrency entered the mainstream.



However, the crypto market’s capitalization peaked shortly after the ad, reaching a high of about US$3 trillion in early November, but now fluctuates around US$1 trillion. Using the total market cap as a metric, if a user had invested US$1,000 when the ad aired, that would now be worth just US$379.60 as of 11 a.m. Monday in Hong Kong. If they had only invested in Bitcoin, it would be worth US$331.



Cronos, the native currency of the Crypto.com-operated Cronos Chain reached an all-time high of US$0.96 in the weeks after the ad aired but has since fallen nearly 90% to US$0.11.



Crypto.com was investing heavily in advertising at that time, paying US$700 million to rename the iconic Staples Center in Los Angeles to Crypto.com Arena for 20 years in November 2021. It ran another ad featuring basketball star LeBron James that aired during the February 2022 NFL Super Bowl.

The meme coin is worth $0.1351 after gaining 130% in seven days.

Six weeks back, DOGE traded at a measly $0.06156, with a market value of $8 billion.

After Elon Musk’s last week’s takeover of the social networking platform Twitter, investor appetite for the most popular meme token has skyrocketed significantly.

Data available on the market tracking website CoinMarketCap shows that Dogecoin (DOGE) has flipped Cardano (ADA) to become the eighth most prominent cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization.

The meme coin currently trades at $0.1351, with over 60% appreciation in the previous 24 hours, putting its seven-day cumulative performance above 130%. Exactly six weeks ago, Coin Edition reported that DOGE had surpassed (DOT) to be the tenth-largest cryptocurrency by market share. At the time, DOGE traded at a measly $0.06156, with a market value barely above $8 billion.

Interestingly, current data from the market shows the DOGE meme token gained over 100% of its value in a month. The current market value of DOGE and ADA are over $18 and $14 billion, respectively, with DOGE leading by over four billion. Notably, DOGE claimed the $4 billion increase over Cardano within 24 hours.

Another interesting fact is that the trading volume of DOGE over ADA within the last 24 hours is over 140% apart. While nearly $15 billion worth of buying and selling happened with the meme token, ADA’s 24-hour trading volume is below $1 million. Nonetheless, the Cardano token’s performance within the previous seven days has been impressive, with over 19% gains.

The crypto market, in general, has been bullish since last week, with BTC gaining over 9%. (ETH) was the second-best performer in the market after DOGE, with over 25% in seven days. Ethereum is worth $1,635, the highest value seven weeks after its blockchain migrated to the efficient proof-of-stake consensus.

In a recent thread, controversial YouTuber Ben Armstrong (a.k.a. “BitBoy”) has addressed his unflattering comments about the XRP community.

Armstrong, who has now positioned himself as one of the biggest cheerleaders of the Ripple-affiliated cryptocurrency, called its supporters “delusional” in a newly resurfaced video clip for lacking fundamental understanding of the market.

In the video, Armstrong mocked outlandish price predictions that were being promoted by some members of the community.

After receiving some pushback from XRP fans, Armstrong has now walked back on his comments. “Fact is, people are capable of getting new information and then changing their minds,” he wrote.

He then suggests that XRP has managed to mature over the past few years, which prompted him to change his opinion.

Last week, the controversial YouTuber said that he wasn’t going to buy meme coin Dogecoin , which recently experienced a massive price spike because of the Twitter news.

Earlier this October, Armstrong predicted that Cardano would end up surpassing Ethereum in a few years from now.

As reported by U.Today , Ledger co-founder Eric Larchevêque recently faced backlash from the XRP community after claiming that the cryptocurrency was centralized. In fact, Larchevêque said that XRP wasn’t even a cryptocurrency.

2022-10-31 10:24:55.891396,Trustnodes,Bitcoin Drone Show Flies Over Lugano,"A bitcoin drone show lit up the city of Lugano in Switzerland’s border with Italy, commemorating the closing of the bitcoin conference Plan ₿.

The show was put on by Cyberdrone, which describes itself as “a drone light show company specializing in high-performance drone development and the creation of autonomous swarm solutions.”

It is the first drone show of its kind, highlighting the gathering of many prominent bitcoiners, including Adam Back, the President of Blockstream.

Max Keiser, a long time bitcoiner, held a key note on “Conquering Time and Space,” so keeping the overhype in the depth of bear.

Other talks were by Jimmy Song who preached to the audience on “How Fiat Ruins Everything.” Everything!

We had Peter McCormack to speak about how “An Attack on Assange is an Attack on Freedom of Speech,” even though for some reason Wikileaks never used its free speech to reveal anything about Russia or China even as both were moving towards dictatorship.

For a further taste of what sort of conference this was, we have a “Masterclass on How to Invest in Bitcoin.” That PhD probably took about one minute, with the speaker not saying you just open an account on one of the exchanges, 100x long and then get rekt, and then next time hodl for life.

But there were more interesting talks, including on defi, and although bitcoin parties are nothing compared to eth-heads, they’re not bad.

There were also NFTs. Well, RGB assets, and RGB here stands for Really Good for Bitcoin because some kids never grew up.

To show its copying nature in addition, they look more like a meme than NFTs, but still somewhat cool.

That’s Peter Todd, whose gotten old-er and now has a beard, holding a cat because the dog has been taken by dogecoin.

The cat is an RGB, which presumably also stands for color. Like the arrival of color TV about half a century ago, or pictures on the internet, blockchains now get their jpegs.

In this case the jpegs are off-chain and linked to bitcoin in a sort of roundabout way with the project stating:

“Each RGB smart contract is represented by some genesis state, created by smart contract issuer (or, put simply, issuer) and a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of state transitions kept in form of client-validated data (i.e. this data is not stored on blockchain or within LN transactions/channel state).

The state is assigned to unspent bitcoin transaction outputs (UTXO), which defines them as single-use seals.

The party that is able to spend corresponding transaction output is named a party owning state: it is a party that has the right to change the corresponding part of the smart contract state by creating a new state transition and committing to it in a transaction spending the output containing previous state.

This procedure represents closing of a seal over state transition, and a pair of spending transaction and corresponding extra-transaction data on the state transition are named witness.”

The address above might look like a bitcoin one, but it’s not, it starts with rgb. In general terms this is effectively an ‘offline’ or off-chain system that kind of ‘pauses’ a transaction to put stuff – link code – to it, like a cat.

This overall performs the basic function of allowing you to own a picture, with the Iris Wallet allowing you to see it.

So bitcoin has kind of made it to around 2017 when the first CryptoKitties clogged ethereum.

That’s progress as it wasn’t clear it would move at all, but it isn’t quite leadership, it is more following and catching up in a somewhat convoluted way where the smart contract code is not on-chain, making its immutability more open to question than otherwise.

That naturally has to apply to all of bitcoin attempted defi. They’re trying to work on DEX-es, that’s decentralized exchanges, which in ethereum are pretty old fashioned things with modern kids nowadays playing on order-less, as in order books, exchanges like Uniswap.

Collateralizing bitcoin in its natural environment would be cool however, but the only way this can be done is by locking your coins to some other network, and in the process many attack vectors would have to be strengthened, including bridges or watchtowers or whatever they’ll use, which haven’t really been tested because no one is quite using them.

That all said, bitcoin excels in stunts, like this pretty cool drone show even though the bitcoin symbol used could be nicer, and one gets the feeling that bitcoin coding may be at least attempting to revitalize after about five years of complete standstill.

They’ve lost a lot of talent to ethereum, and for half a decade now bitcoin was for punk attitude, while eth was for code.

That may change in as far as bitcoin tries to become for code too, but developers have to work with very limited capabilities and self executing open source code will probably never quite be a thing in bitcoin in a way where you have the opportunity to publish unchangable code.

Still, there’s a lot of copycat fruits and they’ll probably blossom eventually once all the low fruits are picked in eth, although bitcoin is bigger and there is opportunity to grab attention especially in native collateralization, but whether that can be done in a way you’re sure your private key is ownership, is not too clear.","A bitcoin drone show lit up the city of Lugano in Switzerland’s border with Italy, commemorating the closing of the bitcoin conference Plan ₿.

The discussion reflected how global carmakers sought to build ties with the mining industry to secure materials needed for the rollout of electric vehicles, the Financial Times reported.

Preliminary discussions about Elon Musk’s electric car and battery maker buying 10-20% of Glencore began in 2021.

The discussions continued in March 2022, when Glencore CEO Gary Nagle visited Tesla’s factory in Fremont, California, as part of a roadshow for the mining company’s annual results.

Tesla was concerned if Glencore’s extensive coal mining business was compatible with the carmaker’s environmental goals and was reluctant to take a minority equity stake.

The rise of electric vehicles has prompted concern among carmakers and battery makers about securing supplies of raw materials such as cobalt, lithium, and nickel.

Musk has outlined Tesla’s intention to take greater control of all manufacturing steps of its batteries, including processing the raw materials and even buying lithium deposits still in the ground.

“Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale unless costs improve,” Musk said.

The price of lithium has risen eightfold since the start of 2021.

Tesla advanced with plans to build its lithium hydroxide refinery on the Texas Gulf Coast.

Glencore produces cobalt, nickel, copper, and other minerals and is also one of the world’s largest recyclers of batteries.

Analysts have been broadly skeptical over whether Musk has the appetite to invest in mining groups or trading houses, suggesting his comments aimed to jolt raw material suppliers into increasing output.

The discussions ended with no deal.","Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) discussed with Glencore Plc (OTC: GLCNF) (OTC: GLNCY) about acquiring a stake in the Swiss commodities group.
