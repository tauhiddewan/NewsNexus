The Drivers of Cardano’s Future Growth – Its Use Cases

Since you are currently reading about price predictions for Cardano in 2023, it shows you are a smart crypto investor. Also, smart crypto investors love to invest in crypto coins with a real use case and sensible ongoing projects.

Here is where we will like to show you the use cases of Cardano that are likely to drive its future growth.

Cardano is built to solve real problems across different industries such as Education, Retail, Agriculture, Government, Finance, and Healthcare. Reissuing lost or damaged academic certifications can be a very difficult process especially if the originating educational institution no longer exists.

Hence, the birth of Atala PRISM, which is an ID & credentials project built on the Cardano blockchain that secures academic certifications for both students and verifying institutions. Also, counterfeit goods are a common retail problem that Cardano aims to solve, as anti-counterfeit initiatives are costly and lengthy with little control effect over the trade of counterfeit goods.

Atala SCAN is Cardano’s solution to this retail problem. It uses blockchain technology to certify that the products sold are original. This solution is particularly important to the healthcare sector as counterfeit medications are a big threat to society.

In addition, the blockchain is trusted for its transparency and Cardano aims to apply this to the agriculture industry using projects like Atala Trace and EMURGO’s solution for traceability in the industry’s supply chain. Atala PRISM is another Cardano solution that provides a digital identity service aimed at correcting the strong dependence on third-party agencies to verify identity documents.

This identity verification solution is also aimed at the finance sector as a solution to accelerate the process of accepting new clients.

2022-10-31 11:48:03.093967,BeInCrypto,Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction: Signs of a Market Bottom,"Cardano (ADA) price has been moving upward since Oct. 21, gaining 22% in market value. Both the wave count and the RSI suggest that the correction is complete, and ADA could enter a new uptrend.

The technical analysis from the weekly chart shows that ADA price has been falling since reaching an all-time high price of $3.10 in Aug. 2021. The crypto bear market has led to a low of $0.33 in Oct. 2022 for Cardano price.

The low and ensuing bounce (green icon) validated the $0.36 horizontal area as support. This is a crucial area that previously acted as resistance in May 2018 and Jan. 2021. After the ADA price broke out, it increased rapidly toward an all-time high.

Sponsored Sponsored

Additionally, the weekly RSI is exceptionally bullish. The indicator has generated bullish divergence (green) and is breaking out from its bearish trendline (black). The breakout would validate the divergence and indicate that an upward movement is likely.

If an upward ADA price movement follows, the closest resistance would be at $0.58.

Cardano (ADA) Price Confirms Bottom

A closer look at the Cardano price action from the daily timeframe shows that the previous decrease began on Sep. 10, after ADA price completed the wave count for its long-term bearish triangle (white).

Afterward, it seems to have completed a five-wave decrease (black), which culminated with the aforementioned $0.33 low.

The ensuing increase suggests that the correction is complete for two reasons:

The $0.44 high on Oct. 29 was above the breakdown level (red circle).

The daily RSI has broken out from its bearish trendline (green) and moved above 50.

Sponsored Sponsored

As a result, both the wave count and RSI support the possibility that the price of Cardano has reached a bottom.

Alternatively, a fall below $0.33 would invalidate this Cardano price prediction and instead indicate that new lows are expected for the price of ADA.

Cardano price has been falling over the past 24 hours, but there is no negative Cardano news that might have caused the fall. As a result, this is likely a short-term correction as a result of the previous increase.

2022-10-31 07:48:03.106816,BeInCrypto,Cardano NFTs: Sales Volume Shines but TVL Remains a Concern,"Cardano NFTs: Despite the “ghost protocol” narratives, Cardano continues to see new heights. Its NFT market is growing rapidly, whereas TVL remains subdued.

Cardano’s NFT space is rapidly growing despite the overall non-fungible token (NFT) downturn in 2021 and even 2022.

In fact, Cardano’s NFT trading volume surge made it the third-largest NFT protocol. They sit right behind the two giants: Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL).

Sponsored Sponsored

Can the gains be sustained here, or will bears capitalize on it?

NFT Market: The Darkest Shade of Gray

The trading volumes for “digital art and collectibles recorded on blockchain” or NFTs saw a massive fall. It slid (by) 97% from a record high in Jan. this year, recording just $466 million in Sept.

For reference, the NFT trading volume registered $17 billion at the start of 2022, according to data from Dune Analytics.

As per a Bloomberg report, the fading NFT mania is part of a wider, $2 trillion wipeout in the crypto sector as rapidly tightening monetary policy starves speculative assets of investment flows.

OpenSea, the largest NFT trading platform by volume, saw its sales drop 75% compared to just two months prior. This is despite the fact that the number of traders hasn’t really fallen much even though the number of trades has collapsed.

Having said that, there was some relief for NFT enthusiasts. As BeInCrypto reported, Redditt NFTs generated over $2 million in sales volume. The spike represented a 1,000% increase in sales volume.

Cardano NFTs: My Turn to Shine

Cardano is touted to be one of the most-developed ecosystems in the crypto market. Despite FUD, the protocol continues to create headlines during the crypto bear run.

Cardano is the third-largest non-fungible token (NFT) protocol by trading volume, according to a report by blockchain and decentralized apps (dApps) analytics firm DappRadar.

“Cardano is currently one of the top three blockchains by NFT trading volume,” the report added.

Sponsored Sponsored

In the past 30 days, the network’s NFT volume reached $191 million, placing Cardano as the third-largest NFT protocol behind Ethereum and Solana.

One can clearly see the spike around the Oct. 22-23 period from the NFT marketplace tracker OpenCNFT.

The Ape Society, Cardano’s biggest NFT project in terms of collection share by 24-hour volume, reached the 10,000 ADA floor price.

Sponsored Sponsored

The said rise did indeed inject much-needed relief. Especially after the NFT volume in Cardano marketplaces had been pretty low in the months between June and the start of Oct.

Cardano Green Pastures

Surprisingly or not, the platform faced backlash in the past. One issue that stood out was the accusation of Cardano being a “Ghost protocol.” This was mainly due to its blockchain worth billions, and yet with limited utility.

However, as Cardano ushers in a new age, ecosystem development to network transactions see bright spots.

Cardano’s network transactions reached 82,880, the greatest number since May. With these numbers, the blockchain network registered a month-to-month increase of 75%.

In fact, the Cardano (ADA) network has grown to hit 97,959 transactions on Oct. 19, a figure that represents a rise of roughly 75% month-on-month.

Work Hard, Play Hard

Needless to say, the increase in trading volume is linked to the Vasil upgrade, which went live on Sept. 22 despite some delays. The upgrade aimed at increasing the network’s capacity while reducing transaction time.

In addition to this, Cardano’s Layer 2 solution, Hydra, witnessed a new update. The respective team highlighted the same on the social media platform that read as:

New release for Hydra: 0.8.0!🐉https://t.co/2U1P1qTaOT



Took a bit longer than last time but it's packed with features:

– Persistence of Head state

– Improved contestation deadline reporting

– Fixed several bugs in the hydra-node

– Improved UX of the hydra-tui

– Static binaries — Sebastian Nagel (@ch1bo_) October 27, 2022

Compiling both these datasets, Cardano’s development activity grew tremendously over the past week. Meanwhile, the number of daily active addresses increased steadily, at present it stands at around 67,000.

So again, speculations around its “Ghost” nature may not hold true. Charles Hoskinson, the Cardano founder wasted no time to acknowledge such narratives. Here’s one for reference:

https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1584901392665

Find the Missing Piece

There are two aspects here: ADA price and its TVL status check. Both of which depict a rather grim scenario.

Talking about the former, the native crypto ADA witnessed a fresh correction of 3% on CoinMarketCap. At press time, ADA remained stagnant around the $0.40 mark despite aforementioned developments/upgrades.

Here’s the price performance in 2022: A bleeding picture to say the least.

Meanwhile, Cardano total value locked (TVL), a common measure of the chain’s size remained unaffected, it even decreased. Cardano TVL has decreased by approximately 20% in the previous thirty days to $70 million.

Still minimal compared to rivals Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL).

Things to Consider for Cardano NFTs

Overall, the Cardano NFT environment has been thriving recently, but the same can’t be said about the NFT market in general.

Cardano’s TVL cast some doubts over the same. This may be partially attributable to investors’ overall negative perception of DeFi.

Indeed, it is time to pull up the socks.

2022-10-30 12:48:03.120765,Bitcoinist,Snowfall – Cardano – Cronos!,"The article walks the readers through a comparison between Snowfall, Cardano, and Cronos.

The increasingly vibrant world of crypto has seen a number of coins emerging by the second; some heroes, some cash cows, some money makers and some money takers. When the customer is flooded with options, it is difficult to make a decision about what to choose, let alone a good one. The same theory and practice applies to crypto. You can find tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies on the market; picking one that is most suitable to your goals and, frankly, your wallet can be a challenging task. In this piece, we shall be comparing Snowfall Protocol (SNW) with Cardano (ADA) and Cronos (CRO).

Cardano (ADA) – A Wise Choice?

Cardano (ADA), an AMM-driven coin, uses liquidity pools to carry out transactions. AMM has a problem because it uses a formula to calculate the price of Cardano (ADA) tokens. Alternatively, in accordance with the rules of a conventional market, demand and supply must decide the price. This is to say that the traditional methodology is typically preferred for a fair appraisal.

Snowfall Protocol (SNW) is now valued at $0.009 per token, while Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.40. Due to this distinction, Snowfall Protocol (SNW) takes precedence over Cardano (ADA).

Cardano (ADA) has stayed more or less stable at its current market price but has little sign of growth. Understandably, its stagnant growth can be justified by high market volatility and instability in the market. It is considered that any project that holds any substantial value shall outperform its competition, and this is a significant takeaway that all investors and traders should look out for. Cardano (ADA) has been in the running for quite some time, but Snowfall Protocol (SNW) takes precedence regarding its effectiveness and reliability.

Cronos (CRO)

It is a native blockchain token devised by the Cronos (CRO) Protocols Labs. Not only is it a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) application, but also an exchange. It provides opportunities such as staking coins, earning rewards, and storing the coins in the wallet. An important feature to note about Cronos (CRO) is that it is not minable. In one place, it is an excellent way of ensuring the effectiveness of proof-of-stake; it also means that one entity can have the most stakes of the coin. For instance, a single person can have his coins staked and earn more through the process of staking. This makes more than 51% of the ownership and control possible. Since a single person or entity shall hold the majority, the other users of that chain are potentially in danger of being held hostage by that entity. This means that a few strong players can control Cronos (CRO). It is in no way implied that the system is designed to help an entity establish its monopoly, but the system can inevitably fall into this dilemma. This counterproductively strikes at the very heart of the idea of decentralization. No matter how good of a platform it may be, Cronos (CRO)is prone to be held hostage.

Snowfall Protocol (SNW)

Snowfall Protocol (SNW), however, appears to be the only option that can prove viable for users. Snowfall Protocol (SNW) is emerging as a giant in the crypto market, and Snowfall Protocol (SNW) is also a first-of-its-kind platform that offers cross-chain or multi-chain transactions. Snowfall Protocol (SNW), being a cross-chain platform, ensures transactions between two architectural models that are secure, safe, and reliable. Snowfall Protocol (SNW) also puts immense emphasis on the safety and security of its users’ transactions and digital assets. To fully realize its claims and seize the opportunity to become the safest platform, it intends to employ top-of-the-line encryption models.

To over-deliver on the claims it makes, Snowfall Protocol (SNW) shall create isolated pools to deter cross-contamination from other coins based on other portfolios. Snowfall Protocol (SNW) cherry picks those coins that offer stable income and returns to users.

The Bottom-Line

One can take the liberty of assuming that Snowfall Protocol (SNW) supersedes Cronos (CRO) and Cardano (ADA) regarding technicalities, safety insurance, reliability, and return on investment. These features are Snowfall Protocol’s (SNW) mark of distinction. Credit should be given where it’s due; Cardano (ADA) and Cronos (CRO) have performed decently in the market. Where credit is due, applause should also be in place for Snowfall Protocol (SNW) for rolling out a state-of-the-art platform.

The price of Snowfall Protocol (SNW) is now $0.009 and is expected to increase 1000X. This makes Snowfall Protocol (SNW) one of the most attractive coins on the market today as investors rush to take advantage of this underpriced presale price. Check out the links below to get involved!

We do not recommend investing money you cannot afford to lose.

Charles Hoskinson, who is getting ready for the big opening of his own restaurant he announced back in July, stated that his business will accept cryptocurrencies as payment. Cardano will obviously be the preferred choice.

Implementing ADA in real business

On June 22, Hoskinson shared a teaser-tweet in which he announced the opening of Nessie's restaurant and a whiskey lounge in Wheatland, Wyoming, the city where Hoskinson lives. The business choice made some of his followers curious as the restaurant business and cryptocurrency development are industries that do not cross that often.

Yes — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) October 30, 2022

However, the main reason behind opening the restaurant was the lack of good options in the town nearby Hoskinson's ranch. During the announcement, Hoskinson confirmed that his restaurant will be crypto-friendly and has recently made the same claim again.

Some users suggested that Hoskinson should think about alternative Cardano-based payment options like the DJED stablecoin that has been brought up in the pro-Cardano narrative. By implementing the stablecoin in the business, the Cardano co-founder would be able to create a real-world use case for the asset immediately after the full launch.

Cardano keeps growing

Through the last year, Cardano's ecosystem saw exponential growth in the number of new solutions and use cases. The network became completely ready for the implementation of NFTs.

The DeFi side of the ecosystem also received a massive boost despite the problematic nature of the eUTxO mechanism in terms of handling numerous transactions in one block. Decentralized finance solutions are now working on the network stably.

Unfortunately, the price performance of Cardano still remains problematic as the asset cannot break the local resistance level at $0.41.","Charles Hoskinson, who is getting ready for the big opening of his own restaurant he announced back in July, stated that his business will accept cryptocurrencies as payment.

2022-10-31 04:48:03.159852,AMBCrypto,Is ADA in trouble given the Cardano co-founder’s itch for a DOGE alliance,"Twice bitten, never shy—That was the aura oozing from Cardano’s [ADA] founder as he asked that Dogecoin [DOGE] become its sidechain. Known for his outspoken nature, Charles Hoskinson had initially suggested that if DOGE accepted to be ADA’s sidechain, he would process the integration for free.

He even went further by saying that he would include smart contracts for the meme cryptocurrency.

Here’s AMBCrypto’s Price Prediction for Cardano [ADA] for 2022-2023

After there was hardly any response from Dogecoin’s end, Hoskinson put out another tweet. In his recent one, on 29 October, he ran a poll. In the poll, he asked the Cardano community if the project should pitch Twitter, the sidechain offer, all integrated with the social network.

Should we pitch to Twitter a post-quantum ultrafast, and identity enabled doge sidechain of Cardano custom built for social networks? #QuantumDoge — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) October 29, 2022

Up to the task?

The requests from Hoskinson all came as Elon Musk sealed the Twitter purchase. Musk has never hidden his support for Dogecoin. Hence, it could be the reason the ADA founder included a “Twitter clause” in his offer. With positives emerging from both camps, it was not out of the question if Hoskinson was desperate for a Twitter and DOGE alliance.

On capability, it was not certain if ADA was up to the task. This was because it had only increased 2.84% in the last 24 hours. On the other hand, DOGE rallied over 127% over the previous seven days. According to CoinMarketCap, DOGE had even surpassed ADA per market value. However, the price correlation alone would mean partiality without considering other parts of the ADA chain.

According to Santiment, ADA seemed to have revived developments after it decelerated weeks after the Vasil Upgrade. Furthermore, the recent Hydra solution might have contributed to the same.

At press time, ADA’s development activity had surged to 128. This increase implied that ADA might be shipping new features to accommodate new chains on its network. Despite the improvement, it was not sure that DOGE would accept the proposal. Neither did it prove that ADA could sustain the meme on its chain.

Considering other measures

On looking at other ADA parts, Santiment showed that the performance was relatively okay. Santiment also showed that its thirty-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio had improved. Following the crypto market recovery, the MVRV ratio rose to 8.743% despite being stuck at -15.57% on 20 October.

This implied that ADA investors had made significant profits recently. In addition, there was a potential even to make more as long the market held on to the greens. Interestingly, more investors added ADA to their portfolios recently. This was due to the 24-hour active addresses increasing to 81,400 on 28 October. Despite the surge, unique addresses involvement had decreased to 65,700.

At the time of writing, neither the DOGE team nor Elon Musk had responded to the Hoskinson offer. With the Hoskinson poll in agreement with his suggestion, we wait to see if the parties targeted would consider his proposal.","In the poll, he asked the Cardano community if the project should pitch Twitter, the sidechain offer, all integrated with the social network.

This initiative is a point of reference for everything Cardano and every week or two we will invite a Stake Pool Operator (SPO) to answer some questions and give us an update directly from within the Cardano community.

Considering that many of our readers are new to the crypto space, we will have a mix of simple and technical questions.

Cardano SPO Column, interview with Kaizen Crypto Stake Pool [KAIZN]

Hi, thanks for your time. Tell us something about yourself, where are you based and what is your background?

Hi, thanks for having me! My name is Pritesh. I’m a Cardano Content creator and Stake Pool Operator (SPO).

I have been involved in Cardano since 2017 and began creating youtube content in 2019.

I’m based in Georgia, United States and have a background in IT and social media marketing.

What’s the path that led you to Cardano and to become Stake Pool Operators (SPO)?

I heard about crypto back in 2013 and passed it off as a scam. Then in 2017, I saw Bitcoin making headlines as it hit record highs consistently each month. That’s when I decided to learn more about crypto.

Like many people, I stumbled across the iconic Charles Whiteboard video. That was my lightbulb moment! I began searching for content and found Rick and Phillipe. I got involved by creating my own channel as well.

During the early days, I wanted to build a stakepool using a Raspberry Pi and document that on the channel. That’s how I got my start during the ITN. Then when Shelley went live on mainnet, I decided to take things to the next level and went with enterprise grade hardware for our stakepools. We now have a thriving community and loyal delegators that have been supporting our team for the long run!

Besides [KAIZN] you’re also running [KRSNA], [KRONO] and [KOBE], can you tell us more? And what are your thoughts on the debate within the Cardano Community about multi-pools?

I operate 4 stake pools on Cardano. KAIZN, KRSNA, KRONO, and KOBE. I’m very grateful to be able to contribute to various causes by operating these pools.

For instance, my owner’s rewards from the KRSNA pool are donated to help those in need. Recently, I flew to Sri Lanka to give food to families struggling with poverty. It was a profoundly impactful experience that enhanced my perspective on life.

The single pool / multi pool debate will continue for the foreseeable future on Cardano. In my opinion, decentralisation of the network is a spectrum. We have passionate single pools who advocate for decentralisation, however, their infrastructure is hosted on the cloud. Is this any more decentralised than a pool operator who runs several pools, but hosts the infrastructure in multiple geo locations on bare metal?

It’s an ongoing debate. I believe that incentives will align behaviour, and currently there are many protocol changes that are being proposed. As a public face of the community, I’ve dealt with fallout from having multiple pools. I believe that changes need to be made at a protocol level to encourage a healthier debate.

What excites you about the future of Cardano? Do you have any upcoming projects you’re looking forward to? What use cases do you think will help us reach mass adoption?

I’m excited about a lot of things coming up for Cardano! Some of the projects include Liqwid Finance, Project NEWM, World Mobile, Cornucopias, Indigo Protocol and so many others!

My team is also building several projects including Lovelace Saga, Cardano Calendar, and I’m even putting together a Cardano 101 course to help newcomers!

Mass adoption will come from applications that make use of blockchain without users knowing. Some examples include streaming royalties for music, DIDs with Atala Prism, or even decentralised telecoms.

Amazing. Any final thoughts? Where can people follow you?

Thanks so much for the opportunity to share some thoughts! The future is bright and I’m very excited to be on this journey with the most amazing community.

Please feel free to follow my work on Youtube and Twitter.

2022-10-31 09:48:03.449487,Bitcoinist,Is Rocketize Meme Token As Smart As Solana and Cardano Currency?,"One of the interesting and eye-catching sets of cryptocurrencies is meme coins. In our increasingly connected society, memes reflect the most recent stage in the evolution of language. The fundamentals of communication have been reinvented in the 21st century to include a blend of comedic, visual, and textual genres. By the adoption of these non-traditional incentive structures, both Decentralised Finance (DeFi) and Decentralised Autonomous Organizations, can reinvent how communities function.

All thanks to Dogecoin for inventing the wheel. Dogecoin was launched in 2013 as a joke against Bitcoin. DOGE’s inspiration came from the Japanese Shiba Inu dog which shows charming features. However, Rocketize is another meme that seeks to become how the public can learn about the benefits of the decentralized network provided by Binance Smart Chain. The developers of Rocketize compare the benefits of Rocketize for BSC and DeFi to Neil Armstrong’s work for humanity. With its undying approach, Rocketize envisioned itself becoming a keyword in crypto space.

Can Rocketize Token Buy The Heart of The Cryptocurrency Fans?

Rocketize is a BEP-20 token that runs on the Binance Smart Chain. Knowing the worth of a community, Rocketize Token carefully makes use of its community’s potential as a multifaceted and ever-expanding talent pool. It accomplishes this, by utilizing Decentralized tools and governance, which allow community members to exercise power over their budgets and choices.

Rocketize Token is involved in creating memes like images, cartoons, movies, audio, and other forms of artistic and educational content. The platform promises to be fun, rewarding, and entertaining to get members ever thrilled with creativities.

The Rocketize Token community, nicknamed “Atomic Nation” is focused on the growth of the economy. This is set to be achieved through the use of its native currency, JATO, along with a collaborative effort of the community members. While it is believed that no one, according to the “chicken before egg” paradox can develop without resources, or grow without a means, Rocketize is out to dispute the fact.

Rocketize has a lot of outstanding rewards for its buyers. JATO might be a good fit especially if bought during its pre-sale.

Is Solana Blockchain Better Thank Ethereum

Solana is one of the top coins in the cryptocurrency space. It is rated among the top 9 with a market cap size of about 11 billion. Solana, as a decentralized platform, is powered by SOL, its native currency.

The Solana blockchain possesses unique features which give an advantage over the Ethereum blockchain. Some of it is its ability to fast transaction speed as well as a low transaction cost. The SOL platform is built to encourage the creation of Decentralized Applications (DApp). The Solana network combines the Proof-of-history with the Proof-of-stake mechanism to produce a scalable platform. Solana might be a good choice if you are considering a long-term investment.

Is Cardano Algorithm More Effective Than The Proof-of-work Mechanism?

Cardano, just like other cryptocurrencies, is a decentralized coin that operates on the Proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. Cardano is designed as a platform for smart contracts, to support the creation of enterprise-level DApps while it offers more sophisticated functionality than any other protocol ever created.

The Cardano platform also aspires to adopt a decentralized governance structure that will let the project develop over time and fund itself sustainably through an innovative treasury mechanism.

Cardano’s “research first” approach to design is one of the most distinctive aspects of the Cardano Project. Cardano can be bought on different available Decentralized Exchanges (DEX).

Bringing Liquid Democracy to Cardano

Let’s start by introducing Cardano.

Cardano is an open-source and decentralized third-generation blockchain. Built completely from scratch with a Proof of Stake consensus algorithm, Cardano aims to solve problems related to scalability, interoperability, and sustainability. Cardano’s currency is named ADA.

You can take a deep dive into Cardano here.

Cardano’s future is self-determined by the community through project Catalyst. Catalyst is one of the largest decentralized innovation funds and is the first step in decentralizing the governance of Cardano. Catalyst is where the Cardano community’s ideas come to life. This means that if anyone has a solution to a local or global problem, they have the opportunity to submit a proposal. This proposal can then get voted on by the community, and funded by the treasury. Project Catalyst brings forward the opportunity for collaboration and collective intelligence. It fosters an environment where anyone can be creative and impactful, by utilizing Cardano to solve real-world problems.

You can learn more about Cardano’s governance here.

Catalyst is developing toward liquid democracy. A first initiative in this step is introducing the concept of DReps. DReps act as public representatives who vote on proposals on behalf of the community. This means that community members can delegate their vote to a DRep, increasing the participation of ADA holders in Catalyst and allowing for expert evaluation of projects. Eventually resulting in collective intelligence.","Photo by Michael Förtsch on UnsplashBringing Liquid Democracy to CardanoLet’s start by introducing Cardano.

2022-10-31 12:48:03.453198,Cryptopolitan,"Bitcoin, Binance Coin, XRP, and Cardano Daily Price Analyses – 30 October Morning Prediction￼","The global crypto market has seen a turn as it couldn’t retain gains. The performance of the overall market has affected Bitcoin, Binance Coin, and others. As the negative trend has set in, gains for some coins have lowered while others have turned recessive. There is a likely chance that the market will turn bullish again as the situation remains favorable. The recent bullish changes have strengthened the market in a significant manner. As the forward march continued, the market attempted to recover its losses.

Jack Dorsey is testing a new social networking site to rival Elon Musk’s Twitter. The co-founder and former CEO of Twitter is inching closer on rivaling social media giants Facebook and Instagram. He is working on Bluesky Social, a decentralized social network that has entered its beta testing phase and is in preparation for its launch. A week before the acquisition of Twitter by Musk, Dorsey had said that he was looking for individuals who would participate the in this important stage of development.

The beta testing for this app involves early access for apps, games, and websites granted to a small number of users. The mentioned access will be available to those users who have successfully completed prior registration requirements. Under this phase, basics like bugs, crashes, and other abnormal behaviors of a particular application are observed and reported for resolution or improvement.

Here is a brief overview of the current market situation analyzing the performance of Bitcoin, Binance Coin, and others.

2022-10-31 09:48:03.455064,Bitcoinist,"Invest In These Green Cryptocurrencies For A Sustainable Future: Big Eyes Coin, Cardano And Avalanche","Ever since Bitcoin (BTC) launched in 2009, critics have pointed out the drastic environmental impacts of crypto mining. To keep the blockchain ledgers intact, miners have to solve complex mathematical puzzles that require high-tech computing power. E-waste produced by these computers is not a friend of the natural ecosystem.

Coins running on the Ethereum (ETH) network have the same issue. All these tokens have the consensus mechanism of proof-of-work (PoW), which requires superior computing power. However, many coins and blockchain networks have devised eco-friendly solutions to the mining problem. Some have pledged to donate to preservation charities, and some have reformed the mining process.

Big Eyes Coin (BIG), Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX) are the green cryptocurrencies that are working towards a sustainable future.

Is Avalanche The ‘Ethereum Killer’?

Loads have discussed how Shiba Inu (SHIB) is the Dogecoin (DOGE) killer. However, Shiba Inu has been around for a while, and it still hasn’t been able to compete with Dogecoin. In regards to blockchain networks, Avalanche (AVAX) was launched as a rival against Ethereum and is supposedly called ‘Ethereum Killer’.

The Avalanche blockchain can provide near-instant transaction finality. AVAX, the native token of the network, is used to pay transaction processing fees, secure the Avalanche network, and act as a basic unit of account among blockchains in the Avalanche network.

Avalanche uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol that allows the miners to mine on their phones! This protocol helps Avalanche in its competition with the Ethereum network and also helps the environment, which is in a dire state because of global warming, plastic pollution and e-waste.

Cardano’s Soul Is Green!

Developed by Ethereum’s co-founder, Charles Hoskinson, Cardano (ADA) is inherently more energy efficient than other cryptocurrencies as it uses proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism. Although Cardano’s main function is acting as an efficient way of digital transactions, it can be used for digital contracts and dApps as well.

With a market cap of $14B and a total of 34B coins in circulation, Cardano is profitable, powerful and purposeful.

Big Eyes Coin, Big Heart Coin

Considering the current state of the planet and strong heat waves around the world, it is more important than ever to clean the oceans. Plastic pollution and rising sea levels contribute to global warming, which further results in wildfires, drought and famine.

Running on the Ethereum blockchain, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is a new token in the market. With an irresistibly cute cat mascot, Big Eyes Coin is on a mission to save the ocean. Not many crypto coins do this, but Big Eyes Coin has pledged 5% of its wallet profits towards ocean preservation projects and the construction of underwater national parks. You ask why? The cute cat loves the fish and can’t go a day without eating sushi!

The cat has got big eyes and a big heart as well.

Final Thoughts

Climate is changing, but some cryptocurrencies are changing even faster. Big Eyes Coin, Cardano and Avalanche have understood their social responsibility while many other coins are still stumbling to contribute towards a brighter natural environment.

Big Eyes Coin has entered stage 6 and has raised over $9M in its presale so far! To celebrate this phenomenal run the meme token has come up with an exciting offer.

Here’s Why","This guide discusses Dogeliens (DOGET), Cardano (ADA), and Nexo (NEXO) as three amazing cryptos worth purchasing before the return of the bull market. Dogeliens (DOGET) is new. Nevertheless, it boasts amazing features and offerings that could help it become the next big cryptocurrency.

Like Cardano (ADA) and Nexo (NEXO), Dogeliens (DOGET) has an amazing price, selling below $1. We look at what makes these amazing below-$1 altcoins worth buying before a possible bull market return beginning with Cardano (ADA).

Cardano: Big Sustainable Crypto Asset Under $1

Cardano (ADA) is among the best crypto projects selling under the dollar and an altcoin providing several means for users to benefit from their holdings. Cardano’s (ADA) Proof-of-Word (PoS) mechanism is integral to the altcoin’s high decentralization, scalability, security, sustainability, fast speeds, low fees, and more.

An innovative crypto, Cardano (ADA) enables developers to execute smart contracts. Its dedication to enabling crypto projects to build and run on its ecosystem makes Cardano (ADA) a choice for creating Web3-based decentralized applications (dApps).

Cardano (ADA) is one of the best altcoins for the non-fungible tokens (NFT) economy. A crypto project with great upside, Cardano (ADA) enables users to earn passive incomes through crypto and NFT trading, staking, yield farming, and ecosystem rewards.

Due to bad market conditions, Cardano’ (ADA) price is down by over 80% and selling below $0.5 over the past month. Cardano’s (ADA) low price, alongside features, capabilities and offerings, make several experts recommend it as the best cryptocurrency to invest in 2022 before a coming bull market.

Nexo: Amazing Crypto for Lending and Borrowing

Nexo (NEXO) is native to a blockchain-based lending platform enabling users to open an instant crypto credit line to obtain instant crypto-backed loans.

Nexo (NEXO) holders can borrow fiat money or crypto assets through collateralization. Borrowers can obtain instant loans up to $2 million, with no origination fees or monthly payments. Furthermore, they can receive funds within 24 hours.

Outside loans, Nexo (NEXO) users can lock their Nexo (NEXO) coins to earn discounts and daily interest of up to 16% annual percentage returns (APRs). Nexo (NEXO) holders are also eligible to receive dividends from Nexo’s (NEXO) profits.

With crypto loans becoming a highly valuable service to expand rapidly in the coming years, Nexo (NEXO) will leverage the service to benefit its users. Thankfully, the altcoin currently sells below $1, making the altcoin arguably the best cryptocurrency to invest in 2022 while awaiting the return of the bull market.

Dogeliens: New Asset for the P2E Gaming Economy

Experts list the new cryptocurrency, Dogeliens (DOGET), among the altcoins with the potential to yield huge gains. For crypto enthusiasts wondering why, consider that Dogeliens (DOGET) boasts several interesting features and capabilities, including play-to-earn (P2E).

Dogeliens (DOGET) promises to become a goldmine of opportunities, helping to bring value to users’ holdings. Dogeliens’ (DOGET) prioritizing its community of users means that the new cryptocurrency will commit to bringing them the best crypto services and ways to earn passive incomes.

Among many things, Dogeliens (DOGET) aims to become a dominant force in the gaming world. The new altcoin will power several NFT P2E-based blockchain games to bring users lots of fun and help them improve their earnings.

At the time of writing, Dogeliens (DOGET) is on pre-sale and is selling below $1. Users who wish to buy can purchase with any of Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Bitcoin (BTC), and more for a chance to earn a bonus of up to 22%.

Final Thoughts

2022-10-31 07:48:03.468269,Watcher Guru,"“Dogecoin finally has use case,” says Cardano creator as DOGE takes over ADA","Following Elon Musk’s controversial Twitter takeover, his favorite cryptocurrency Dogecoin [DOGE] has been trending. The asset has been garnering the attention of several across the industry. Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson happens to be one among them.

Right after Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion, Hoskinson took to Twitter and put up a poll for the community. He proposed rolling out a new version of the OG meme coin, a “post-quantum ultrafast, and identity enabled DOGE sidechain of Cardano.”

Should we pitch to Twitter a post-quantum ultrafast, and identity enabled doge sidechain of Cardano custom built for social networks? #QuantumDoge October 29, 2022

About 80 percent of the 21,486 participants voted in favor of this upgrade. However, several others rushed in and pointed out how Hoskinson had formed a sudden inclination towards Dogecoin. Billy Markus, the founder of the DOGE network was one among them.

Dogecoin finally has a use case. If elon decides to use it for twitter, then there are automatically 200 million users and a usecase. That's a lot more real than memes — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) October 30, 2022

Replying to Markus’s tweet, Hoskinson suggested that Dogecoin had finally managed to have a utility. However, this would depend on Elon Musk and his incorporation of DOGE into Twitter.

An array of DOGE supporters came forward and noted how the community had just begun realizing the asset’s power.

Dogecoin climbs the crypto ladder as its market cap soars to $15.57 billion

As mentioned earlier, Musk’s Twitter takeover seems to have started a whole new chapter for Dogecoin. The asset has been trying to enter the coveted top 10 for quite some time now. Over the weekend, DOGE climbed the crypto ladder and took over assets like Cardano [ADA] as well as Solana [SOL].

At press time, Dogecoin stood as the 8th largest crypto while its market cap was seen to be $15.57 billion. Cardano was just below DOGE with a market cap of $13.76 billion.

In terms of price, DOGE witnessed a massive spike over the weekend. The altcoin rose to a high of $0.1494 following 97 percent weekly gains. However, during publication, the meme coin recorded a 14.79 percent daily drop pushing its price down to $0.1152.

Despite this daily drop, the asset continues to remain the talk of the crypto town. Similar to Hoskinson, several other proponents and crypto networks are likely to collaborate with the Dogecoin network thanks to Elon Musk.","Following Elon Musk’s controversial Twitter takeover, his favorite cryptocurrency Dogecoin [DOGE] has been trending.

2022-10-30 12:48:03.479271,CryptoMode,"+100% For Oryen Network Buyers Already, Cardano And Shiba Inu Whales Say ORY Is Going To Moon – CryptoMode","The current crypto winter has wrecked some of the most significant crypto projects. However, even in these gloomy times, opportunities for profitability are many. One of the best ways to ensure this profit is to invest in a project in its early stages.

Getting in early means getting into a project even before its official launch. That often means going for a presale. With a crypto presale, an investor buys coins at hugely discounted prices. However, finding a good project can be challenging. One way to make the right choice is to follow the numbers.

Oryen Network – a Promising Project

One of the most promising projects in the crypto world right now is Oryen Network. Even in the current environment, this project has all the markings of a good investment. One of its most important aspects is that it offers something unique.

The Oryen Network protocol offers a fixed APY of 90%. That is the highest guaranteed APY of any crypto project today. It also uses a unique staking model that does not require participants to deposit funds into a smart contract. Consequently, users are assured of the security of their tokens.

Crypto Whales Agree

One thing that most crypto investors regret is not getting in early. When the opportunity passes, the price can skyrocket hundreds of times in a few days. As it happens, those who had the forethought to get in early often reap big. While it is possible to make some profit, the big opportunities are gone for the rest.

Some investors have been so lucky that an investment of a few hundred has turned into millions in just a few days. That is why it is essential to see the signs of a good investment and get in early. The crypto world is unforgiving to those who wait on the sidelines.

A promising sign that Oryen Network is a good project is what the whales have been saying. Thus far, Cardano and Shiba Inu whales have been saying good things about this project. It is worth noting that both Shiba Inu and Cardano are projects that surpassed all expectations. At their All-Time Highs, these projects had made their most prominent investors millionaires in a few weeks.

Oryen Network is showing signs of being the next breakout crypto platform. It has an intuitive developer team, and its value proposition is built on solid ground. Thus far, its early supporters have shown belief in this project. They have already gained 100% on their investment, which is 2X growth in a short time.

While it is impossible to be sure that a crypto project will succeed, one can always read the signs. They can also listen to what the whales are saying. Thus far, they are chiming in favor of the Oryen Network. Since it is still in the presale, investors could make just a small investment and it could end up paying big over time.

2022-10-31 09:48:03.490807,CryptoMode,"Tired Of Overhyped Cryptocurrency Projects? Why Not Give These Tokens A Try Cardano, Uniswap & Big Eyes Coin – CryptoMode","It’s been a common dilemma within the crypto community that the projects that get hyped the most are often the ones with solid returns. However, most of this hype is temporary, and those projects are soon abandoned by their holders. That’s why today you’ll go through several crypto projects that don’t rely much on hype but are reputable for their blockchain utility.

Coins like Cardano (ADA), Uniswap (UNI) & Big Eyes Coin (BIG) are all big contenders when you are looking for tokenomics, demand, and roadmap. So, without wasting much time, let’s review them one by one.

You Ask, It Answers – The Cardano (ADA)

The first crypto project on the list that has shown continued growth over the years is Cardano (ADA). It was co-founded by Charles Hoskinson, who was also behind the development of the Ethereum (ETH) network. ADA is funded by EMURGO and IOG labs, both of which are known for their software deployment and access. At the same time, its development is coordinated by the Cardano Foundation, whose headquarters is based in Switzerland. ADA’s blockchain supports developers, on-chain users, and decentralized applications.

Its leading utility is implementing a proof of stake consensus mechanism and providing scalable solutions to different smart contracts. At the time of writing, ADA’s blockchain can process more than 500 transactions per second, and this number is projected to rise with future upgrades. As for the price action, ADA hasn’t seen substantial uptrend charts even after all the announcements and developments. However, with a maximum supply of 45 billion, it has a huge potential for the long term.

Eliminate The Middle Man – Uniswap (UNI)

Uniswap (UNI) is another DEX gem that hasn’t received much attention in the community. It’s a decentralized exchange token that aims to eliminate third-party access in the Defi space. Hyden Adams founded UNI to bring on-chain market-maker protocols to the public. Since then, UNI has been running on the Ethereum (ETH) network, providing support to trade several ERC-20 tokens.

Uniswap Exchange runs on global liquidity pools, which differs from centralized exchanges. It allows traders full autonomy while at the same time avoiding liquidity problems. As for the token, UNI holders have the right to vote for governance, much like any other DAO platform. UNI’s maximum supply is limited to 1 billion, with more than half locked by the network. Its ATH was around the $42 mark, and since then, it’s been on a downtrend.

Cutesy, Cuddly and A Consumate Professional – Big Eyes Coin (BIG)

Finally, in 3rd spot, you have Big Eyes (BIG). It’s a meme token project that has gained many holders over the months. BIG was initially released to compete against many meme cryptocurrencies in the niche. It wanted to make itself apart, and it did by certifying itself with Coinsniper and Solidity Finance. These two are big players in crypto regulation and scam protection.

Besides that, the BIG development team has planned to launch their unique NFTs after the presale, which could be minted on the chain. At the time of writing, BIG has gained more than $3 million from its token sales. Unlike its competitors, its maximum supply is fixed at 200 billion, which could be detrimental to its price. With strong tokenomics and an on-set reputation, only time will tell if BIG can surprise us all.

Big Eyes (BIG) Buying Guide for Presale

Luckily, BIG’s development team has allowed their token sales even before their official launch. To get this cryptocurrency, head to their main page and link your blockchain wallet. Once that’s done, exchange your wallet tokens (USDT) with BIG, and that’s it.

These were some of the projects that didn’t just rely on their hype but also analyzed their future potential. Whether it’s BIG or ADA, you will probably see them build their reputation from the ground up if everything goes great in their roadmaps and fundamentals following the next bull run.

2022-10-31 06:48:03.501923,Crypto Reporter,"Cardano (ADA), Algorand (ALGO) or Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)? Here Is Some Info to Help You Choose","Investing into web3 projects with real-world use cases is one of the most carefully considered aspects by investors. Due to this, investors in other cryptocurrencies like Cardano (ADA) and Algorand (ALGO) are looking into investing in Orbeon (ORBN), which is set to rise in value while offering real-world use cases. Currently, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is rapidly selling out its first phase of the public presale, and with its game-changing features it is easy to understand why.

>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<

Cardano (ADA)

Cardano was one of the earliest blockchains to adopt a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus method, it was founded in 2015 and released with a $62.2 million initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017. Since its introduction, Cardano has been working to improve the constraints of its fellow layer 1 blockchains with the aim to revolutionise cryptocurrency. Cardano seeks to deliver the scalability, interoperability, and sustainability required for real-world applications.

The Cardano Network’s native token is called ADA. Like all cryptocurrencies it is a safe exchange of value, meaning that no third party is needed to broker the transfer, and every transaction made is logged on the Cardano blockchain permanently, safely, and transparently.

However, due to a recent delay in the release of Cardano’s long-awaited Vasil update, investor trust has been affected and many stakeholders have been more dubious about the project. Regardless of this project’s utility and smart contract capability has rallied more support in recent months.

Cardano’s market capitalization remains at $12.2 billion, and at the time of press ADA was recently trading for $0.36. It has changed by -4.90% during the last week and is now worth $0.34. The long-term outlook is positive, and many investors hope to see ADA break out from its current level and surpass $2 in the coming year.

Algorand (ALGO)

Algorand is a blockchain network that is self-sustaining, decentralised, and supports a broad range of applications. Algorand’s systems provide the crucial qualities of security, scalability, and efficiency needed for successful applications in a real-world setting.

The Algorand blockchain uses what it refers to as a permissionless, pure proof-of-stake (PPoS) consensus system that finalises blocks in milliseconds to contend with bank and payment networks for transaction processing. According to the Algorand Foundation, the network can handle 1,200 transactions per second (TPS).

The native coin for the Algorand blockchain, ALGO, is utilised to protect the network and cover transaction costs. The initial coin offering (ICO) for Algorand (ALGO) took place in June 2019 at a token price of $2.40. As of the time of press Algorand (ALGO)’s market capitalization is $2.2 billion, and it trades at $0.31 after moving -1.65% in the previous week.

Orbeon Protocol

Orbeon Protocol is a blockchain investment platform that links conventional startups with the cryptocurrency market. As one of the first cryptocurrency crowdfunding platforms in the world, Orbeon Protocol allows users to make minimal investments in unique and interesting new startup companies that otherwise would not be available to the everyday investor.

The crypto community has displayed a flurry of interest in Orbeon as it offers the community an ecosystem with real-life applications in a way that has never been done before. By minting these unique business opportunities as NFTs, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) fractionalizes the newly created NFTs to enable investors to buy into the next unicorn startups for as little as $1. This disrupts the crowdfunding and venture capital industries, opening these unique opportunities up to the wider public.

Another unique feature of Orbeon Protocol is its “Fill or Kill” mechanism which protects consumer investment in the event that the prospective startup fails to reach its fundraising goal, completely refunding any investments.

The Orbeon platform is powered by the ORBN utility token, of which 40% are now available for public presale, with an initial starting price of $0.004. With the buzz surrounding the project however, analysts forecast a presale price increase of 6,000% to $0.24.

Ainsi, en 7 jours, la capitalisation du memecoin a plus de doublé, au point de dépasser celle des blockchains Solana (SOL) et Cardano (ADA).

Grande semaine pour le Dogecoin (DOGE)

Cette semaine a été bonne pour l'ensemble des cryptomonnaies suite à une remontée du Bitcoin (BTC), résultat de la conjonction de facteurs économiques favorables, notamment suite à la publication de résultats trimestriels positifs pour la plupart des grandes entreprises américaines. Mais malgré cette remontée quasi générale, certaines cryptomonnaies sortent encore du lot.

C'est le cas du Dogecoin (DOGE), cette cryptomonnaie créée en 2013, qui ne devait jamais être plus qu'une simple blague. Et pourtant, à l'heure de l'écriture de ces lignes, le DOGE siège à la 8e place du classement des cryptomonnaies en termes de capitalisation boursière.

Effectivement, là où le BTC et l'Ether (ETH) ont respectivement gagné 7,7 % et 21,6 %, le DOGE a surperformé le reste du marché et affiche une progression fulgurante de 111% sur la même période.

Ainsi, la désormais célèbre cryptomonnaie à l'effigie d'un Shiba Inu a pu bénéficier de l'élan général du marché, mais également de l'achat de la plateforme Twitter par Elon Musk, une acquisition qui aurait pu se régler devant les tribunaux, mais qui a finalement été finalisée cette semaine.

Effectivement, le DOGE est bien connu pour être la cryptomonnaie favorite du milliardaire, au point même qu'il soit parfois possible de l'utiliser comme moyen de paiement chez Tesla, entreprise dont Elon Musk est le PDG.

Une hausse passagère ?

Le Dogecoin a ainsi profité d'un élan tout à fait remarquable, et prouve également que son cours reste très corrélé à divers facteurs extérieurs peu prévisibles, ce qui provoque des vagues d'achat soudaines. Aussi, lorsque nous jetons un œil à l'indicateur Relative Strenght Index (RSI), nous pouvons constater que le DOGE a été largement suracheté sur la semaine.

Cours du DOGE, avec la zone de surachat délimitée au-dessus de 70 sur la partie inférieure de la capture d'écran

Bien que cela n'augure pas nécessairement une baisse de son cours aussi soudaine que sa récente hausse, cela peut au moins laisser présager une correction ou une volatilité amoindrie à court terme de ce dernier.

En parallèle d'une hausse générale du volume de trading sur le DOGE, nous pouvons également constater une hausse importante du nombre de transactions pour les whales.

Nombre de transactions sur le DOGE avec un montant supérieur à 100 000 dollars

Par conséquent, la capitalisation boursière du DOGE s'est également accrue de façon considérable. Effectivement, cette dernière dépassait tout juste les 8 milliards de dollars en début de semaine et a plus de doublé sur la semaine, jusqu'à atteindre les 19,8 milliards de dollars lors de son point le plus haut au 29 octobre. La capitalisation du DOGE a toutefois continué de grimper de plus de 17,5 % sur les dernières 24 heures.

Ainsi, le DOGE a dépassé la capitalisation boursière de Solana (SOL) et de Cardano (ADA), ce qui, encore une fois, le place à la 8e place du podium des cryptomonnaies.

2022-10-30 12:48:03.777647,CoinChapter…,TA Analysts Forecast Cardano To Reach Above $5 In 2023 And Why Uniglo.io Could Reach Same Heights,"Technical analysis (TA) has been a fundamental part of investment research for some time. While it has its critics, TA can still be used to predict which investments might be gearing up for significant moves or price gains. Technical analysis tends to ignore market conditions and sentimental research ideas to focus on chart patterns. Many of these patterns indicate that an investment is about to change direction, and fortunes have been made from technical analysis alone.

There’s one token that analysts have been looking at closely, and they believe it could be due a change in fortune soon. They think that Cardano could be gearing up for a surge and may reach a price point of above $5 in the coming year. Other experts also believe that Uniglo could enjoy a similar future and become one of the next breakout stars in the crypto world. Here’s why:

Uniglo (GLO)

You don’t have to do too much technical analysis to know that Uniglo is primed for future price success. That’s because it’s already gaining traction and is up in price considerably during its final pre-sale phase. There’s still time left to add GLO to your portfolio at discount pre-sale prices, so now might be the time to act before it officially launches in a few weeks.

GLO has the best deflationary measures ever seen in crypto, with a secure price base thanks to an asset-backed store of value, alongside ultra-burn mechanics. No matter what the investment charts say, Uniglo could be a great pick for your portfolio.

Cardano (ADA)

Technical analysis has suggested that Cardano might be primed for growth. While this veteran altcoin has enjoyed many ups and downs, experts still think it has a future as the heart of the smart contract world. This means it could be a good addition to your portfolio, especially if the technical analysis is correct.

Conclusion

GLO and ADA have room to grow, and surges might be on the horizon, but Experts like GLO the most and think it could be the best addition to your portfolio over the coming months.

2022-10-31 09:48:03.779727,Bitcoinist,NFTs In A Nutshell: A Weekly Review,"Move aside, traditional playmakers in NFTs. The buzz this past week wasn’t with Ethereum or Solana powered NFTs, but rather with new emerging players. That’s right, we saw some ‘unusual suspects’ with blockchains like Cardano and Aptos making noise in the NFT space this past week.

We’ll review those, as well as some of the biggest headlines in the NFT space – including moves from major tech and social behemoths like Twitter and Apple – in our weekly Nutshell. Let’s dive in.

This Week’s Non-Fungible Token News

Twitter’s New ‘NFT Tweet Tiles’

Last week, it was Reddit’s time to shine as the social media platform had a $2.5M day in NFT sales, and sold out of their initial 40K NFT distribution in less than a day. However, this past week was certainly Twitter’s time to take the realm. Between an Elon Musk takeover that would take the company from public to private ownership, and rumors of a new crypto wallet in development, the social media still managed to find time to announce testing of a new NFT feature.

The new feature, titled by the dev team as ‘NFT Tweet Tiles,’ aims to allow a handful of NFT marketplaces and platforms the ability to have in-app displays of NFTs for buying and selling.

Apple Addresses NFTs… With A Lot To Be Desired

Let’s say you have an app that is listed on the Apple App Store: can you, or can’t you, sell NFTs? Well, if there was any question before, you can put it to rest after this week. However, the answer isn’t likely the most appetizing for those educated with the space.

Apple’s new NFT terms for it’s app store specify that while NFTs are approved for minting, listing, and transferring, sales of NFTs on apps would be subject to Apple’s criticized collection fees (roughly 30%). Additionally, NFT ownership within apps cannot “unlock features or functionality” within any app, meaning that you can throw in-app utility potential out of the window.

Overall, it’s simply not a model that makes sense for NFTs, making this progress in name only for Apple and blockchain technology.

New DC Comics NFTs

Iconic comic book studio DC Comics has rolled out ‘Superman’ NFTs as their latest digital engagement activation. It’s the latest powerhouse IP to see ‘digitization’ via NFTs as DC Comics, a Warner Bros subsidiary, shows a continued investment in the space. We’ve seen other IP from the studio, such as Batman, as well as other Warner Bros. owned IP, like Looney Tunes, find their way to NFTs over the course of the past year. We’ll see what comes next from the legacy studio.

Aptos (APT) has been live for less than two weeks, but has already found a home for NFT consumers. | Source: APT-USD on TradingView.com

A New Player In Town? Aptos Enters The Arena

Aptos has been all the talk of the town lately, and is seemingly making swift moves into NFTs. The blockchain is brand new after years of hype and development, but it took no time at all for Aptos-based NFTs to gain steam; as our team at Bitcoinist covered early last week, some projects with free or cheap mints quickly found their way to $1K+ floor prices, as the chain introduces itself to the latest in a growing roster of potential ‘Solana killers.’

No Bear Market Here, Cardano

Speaking of ‘Solana killers,’ should Cardano be considered a legitimate threat in the NFT sector? Surges in volume suggest perhaps so, as they’ve hit record-highs for the blockchain recently. A DappRadar report published in recent days noted that Cardano has pushed to be the third-largest NFT protocol in volume (behind top dogs Ethereum and yes, Solana).

Solana-challengers like Cardano, the aforementioned Aptos, Avalanche, Flow, and more will allow the entire ecosystem to flourish and improve (Solana included).

Azukis Go IRL, Bring In Over 1,800 ETH

Who said Azukis were dead? Well, plenty of NFT naysayers might’ve said so, but Azuki whales stepped up and made their presence known when bidding was live for eight 24K gold-plated skateboards last week. The custom skateboards brought in over 200 ETH a piece, boasting the title of the most expensive skateboards sold in documented history. The top buyer shelled out a cool 309 ETH for their board – each of which, of course, came with a paired NFT.

2022-10-31 05:48:03.790899,The Herald,The most profitable cryptocurrency to buy in 2023,"Unlike traditional investment markets such as the s&p 500 and the nasdaq, the cryptocurrency arena has emerged as a burgeoning space in recent years. this is primarily due to the extreme returns many cryptocurrencies have generated over the past few years, outperforming even the stock market and other investment vehicles renowned for their stability and reliability. some of these cryptocurrencies include bitcoin, ethereum, and ripple, which already boasts a market cap of billions of dollars and continues to grow at an unprecedented pace.

By investing in cryptocurrencies today, individuals can gain access to a class of assets that could change the landscape of investment markets forever. whether one chooses to invest a small or significant sum, there is no denying that investing in cryptocurrency offers exciting opportunities for growth and profit that simply cannot be found elsewhere.

That said, the cryptocurrency market is more volatile than other markets and can have bear markets that can wipe out significant amounts of value. for instance, the 2022 cryptocurrency bear market has wiped out more than 70% off most cryptocurrencies. the good news is that this presents an opportunity to profit even more once the market rebounds.

If you want to maximize returns, here is the most profitable cryptocurrency to buy today.

A closer look at the most profitable cryptocurrencies to buy in 2023

The entire cryptocurrency is trading at massive lows. from a market capitalisation of close to $3 trillion towards the end of 2021, it is now hovering around $900 billion. Interestingly, most cryptocurrencies have experienced increased adoption and improved technical fundamentals despite dropping prices.

Anyone who chooses to buy cryptocurrencies at current prices could get a good return in 2023.

Below, we take an in-depth look at the top profitable cryptocurrencies to invest in 2023. Each has lots of potential due to a heavy price discount and fast-growing fundamentals.

Shiba inu

Shiba inu is a top meme coin that easily stands out as a profitable cryptocurrency to invest in.

Shiba inu entered the market in late 2020 and was designed to capitalise on the growing popularity of dogecoin and other meme coins. Though its creators initially conceived of it simply as a joke, shiba inu has continued to surprise and impress investors with its steady gains over the past year. It was one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in 2021, with gains of over 40 million per cent.

And with momentum on its side, shiba inu shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. For instance, the shiba inu team has launched a layer-2 solution to make shib scale better, a metaverse, and pay and burn feature to cut down on the number of tokens in circulation.

With these developments, a growing community and shiba inu is trading at a massive discount from its most recent highs. This is coupled with the fact that shiba inu is now available on most top cryptocurrency exchanges like etoro. in another rally, shiba inu stands out as a highly profitable cryptocurrency to buy in 2023.

>>>Buy shib now<<<

Virtual currencies are highly volatile.Your capital is at risk.

Chainlink

Chainlink is one of the most obvious inclusions in the list of top-performing cryptocurrencies to buy in 2023. That's because, in terms of its fundamentals, chainlink ranks among the top leading cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum. chainlink has a lot of similarities to bitcoin that give it a high potential to go up in value long term.

For instance, just like bitcoin, chainlink has market dominance. While bitcoin dominates the entire market, chainlink has built dominance in the decentralised oracles market. It controls more than 60 per cent of this market, and almost all the major smart contract chains use chainlink data oracles for their smart contracts. This means there is very little chance that chainlink will ever lose its market dominance.

The odds are that chainlink is hugely undervalued at current prices thanks to such strong fundamentals. Since it made all-time highs in 2021, chainlink has lost a significant portion of its value – more than 75 per cent off its most recent all-time highs.

Going into 2023, chainlink has a good chance of being a profitable cryptocurrency for exponential gains due to the upcoming staking feature. While it has not yet been introduced, there is speculation that chainlink staking will become a thing soon. Once it is introduced, we could see the number of people who opt to buy chainlink increase in anticipation of the passive income that will come with staking.

Sandbox

The metaverse is growing, and sandbox is one of the top metaverse cryptocurrencies in the market today. This makes it an easy pick for the top profitable cryptocurrency to invest in 2023. Sandbox has a lot going for it, making it a good metaverse cryptocurrency to buy.

For instance, there is growing adoption of the sandbox relative to most other metaverse cryptocurrencies. For instance, in 2022, sandbox inked a deal with warner music for virtual concerts to start taking place on the sandbox metaverse. At the same time, top musicians have started performing on the sandbox metaverse, including Snoop Dogg.

With such high-profile adoption, sandbox will likely draw more money relative to other metaverse cryptocurrencies going into the future. Sandbox and other top cryptocurrencies also stand to benefit from the fact that governments are increasingly making regulations and investments that favour this market.

For instance, the governments of South Korea and Japan have made considerable investments to ensure that the metaverse takes off in their countries. This means there is a lot of hope for cryptocurrencies like sandbox to do well going into the future.

The best part is that sandbox is currently trading at a huge discount from its all-time highs in 2021. If it retests its most recent all-time highs, sandbox would give investors an roi of over 200 per cent. This would make it one of the top most profitable cryptocurrencies to buy today.

While there are no guarantees in the cryptocurrency market, the odds clearly favor sandbox in the short to medium term.

Cardano

Cardano is one of the most technically advanced cryptocurrencies in the market today. As such, it stands out as a profitable cryptocurrency to invest in right now.

One of the key factors that makes cardano a good cryptocurrency to buy is that its proof-of-stake algorithm is one of the best in the market. Even ethereum, which recently transitioned to proof-of-stake, can't match cardano in terms of efficiency.

Cardano's proof-of-stake algorithm is decentralised, scalable, and secure. it can maintain a balance between these three key aspects of the blockchain even as network adoption grows.

Besides its technical capabilities, cardano adoption points to a cryptocurrency that is on a growth trajectory. for instance, since the introduction of cardano smart contracts back in 2021, network adoption has grown. Even metaverse projects are now building on cardano. This is a pointer to the long-term growth of cardano in the long run.

At the same time, cardano's price prediction action points to a potential for growth in the short to medium term. That's because cardano is currently trading at massive lows, off more than 70 per cent its most recent high, and is currently trading at under $0.50. If cardano were to retest all-time highs again, then cardano would give investors a return of over 200 per cent.

Avalanche

Avalanche stands out among the top-performing cryptocurrencies to buy today. Avalanche makes it to this list for its capabilities as a stable and highly scalable platform blockchain.

Thanks to its abilities, avalanche now has one of the fastest ecosystems of projects building on top of it. From defi to nfts, avalanche has emerged as one of the most credible defi cryptocurrencies in the market today.

Besides its growing strengths as an ethereum competitor in the smart contracts market, avalanche is currently trading at record lows from its 2021 highs. Avalanche is trading at under $20, down from highs of over $100 back in 2021.

This means if avalanche were to just return to its all-time highs, it would give investors a return of over 300 per cent from its most recent highs. This is a potentially high return and from a cryptocurrency that also has some pretty good prospects long term.

Polygon

Next on the list of top most profitable cryptocurrencies to buy and hold is polygon. Polygon is the largest ethereum layer-2 chain and already has a large and fast-growing ecosystem of cryptocurrencies building on top of it.

Besides its position as a top ethereum layer-2, polygon's tokenomics make it a top profitable cryptocurrency to buy now. Since mid-2022, polygon has become deflationary, which means the more it is adopted, demand will drive up the price due to the basic economics of demand and supply.

Even with all these fundamentals in favor of polygon's growth, polygon is currently trading at a significant discount compared to its 2021 highs. At its current price, polygon has the potential to give investors a return of over 200 per cent if it retests its most recent all-time highs.

With the odds that the cryptocurrency market could now be trading at the bottom or is very close to it, polygon's potential value in 2023 is pretty high. You will also love that polygon is available on almost all top cryptocurrency exchanges, including etoro.

Cosmos

Next in the list of top cryptocurrencies to invest in right now is cosmos. Cosmos entered the market in 2019 to solve the problem of blockchain interoperability. This concept refers to the ability of two or more blockchains to communicate and share data, even though their underlying networks utilise different coding languages and consensus algorithms.

By enabling interoperability between a wide range of blockchains, cosmos has revolutionised the way we think about distributed systems and peer-to-peer networks. Their ultimate vision is one where any blockchain can interoperate with any other blockchain to support new use cases and create innovative applications.

Whether you are a developer looking for an easier way to integrate blockchain into your projects or someone interested in learning more about this emerging technology, cosmos is sure to be at the forefront of your mind. With its roots firmly planted in innovation and progress, this platform will undoubtedly pave new paths on the road ahead for many years to come.

Cosmos has the potential to open up new avenues for collaboration, paving the way for the development of what some have dubbed web 3.0 – an interconnected web of decentralised online services underpinned by blockchain technology. whether or not cosmos ultimately succeeds in this ambitious endeavor remains to be seen, but it has already sparked much excitement within the blockchain community, heralding a powerful shift in how we think about data sharing and exchange.

Currently, cosmos is trading at more than 70 per cent off its recent all-time highs. With adoption on a growth trajectory, the odds are that cosmos value will increase over time, especially if bulls return to the market. This makes cosmos one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy and hold with a potential for exponential gains.

Ethereum – platform blockchain with massive potential due to improving fundamentals

There are many options to choose from when it comes to investing in cryptocurrencies. Some are still in the early stages of development, while others have already established themselves as industry leaders. One cryptocurrency that is well-established yet still holds impressive growth potential is ethereum.

Not only does this digital currency currently boast a multi-billion-dollar market capitalisation, but its value has continued to rise steadily in recent years. To understand why ethereum is a profitable cryptocurrency to buy, consider its price action since its launch. When ethereum conducted an initial coin offering (ico) back in 2014, it was selling at under a dollar. Today, it is worth over $1000, meaning that anyone who invested at that time could have seen a several hundred percent return on their investment today.

With the recent shift to proof-of-stake, ethereum is a good buy today as it is set to gain even more traction. That's because ethereum is now deflationary and is set to scale even better and with a lower impact on the environment. So now might be the perfect time to get involved with ethereum, as it has what it takes to be one of the most profitable cryptocurrencies to buy in 2023.

To get an idea of how good of an investment ethereum is today, consider that it seems to have found support at the $1000 level. This means if it were to raise in 2023 and retest it's all-time highs, ethereum price prediction could give investors a return of over 200 per cent.

Dogecoin – number one meme coin with a fast-growing community.

Hype is one of the biggest factors regarding cryptocurrency value appreciation. This was most evident during the 2021 bull market when the most hype cryptocurrencies were the best performers. For this reason, dogecoin makes it to the list of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in 2023.

Dogecoin was launched at a time when the concept of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology were just beginning to gain mainstream recognition. Launched in early 2013, dogecoin quickly became one of the most established tokens in this rapidly growing market. At its launch, dogecoin was trading for just $0.0002 per token, but this soon skyrocketed as its popularity grew and more people began to take an interest in this groundbreaking new technology.

The rise of dogecoin would not have been possible without the support of elon musk. As CEO of Tesla, Musk is known for his forward-thinking ideas about technology and business. In early 2021, he expressed his admiration for dogecoin through positive tweets about the project. These tweets not only sparked a wave of new interest in this cryptocurrency, but also prompted speculation that Musk himself might be involved with the development of dogecoin or other related projects. Whatever the case may be, this endorsement from such a powerful figure helped to solidify dogecoin's place as one of the most prominent cryptocurrencies on the market. Thanks to this combination of longevity and enthusiastic support from influential figures like Musk, dogecoin continues to prosper today and seems poised for continued success well into the future.

The Musk effect was so high that by May 2021, dogecoin was trading at $0.77. while Musk may not be such an influential figure on dogecoin anymore, his tweets opened dogecoin to more adoption and community growth.

Now that dogecoin is over 80 per cent off its 2021 highs, this large and growing community could see dogecoin rally in 2023. If dogecoin rallies from its current price, it could easily do 4x from its current price. That's why it stands out among the top most profitable cryptocurrencies.

Defi coin – new high-growth defi cryptocurrency with high yields and token swaps.

Decentralised finance is on a growth trajectory despite the slump in cryptocurrency prices in 2022. For this reason, next-gen defi cryptocurrencies like defi coin are in a unique place for growth going into the future. That's why at current prices, defi coin makes it to the list of most profitable cryptocurrencies to buy in 2023.

Defi coin is taking the defi market by storm. Led by a highly qualified and experienced team of developers, defi is focused on creating an innovative platform that is fully secure and reliable in all areas.

One exciting development for defi coin is the upcoming launch of the defi swap exchange. The team behind this innovative platform has been working tirelessly on the final stages of its development, and it looks like everything is on target for a seamless launch. With defi swap, users can buy and sell tokens without going through a third party or opening an account. Furthermore, transactions are carried out anonymously using smart contracts, which ensure timely, secure execution of all trades. given these features, now could be a good time to buy defi coin before defi swap officially launches.

Besides being a relatively new cryptocurrency, defi coin is likely to keep drawing in investors looking for exponential gains once the markets gain traction. New cryptocurrencies tend to do well when fomo hits the market, which means defi coin stands out as one of the top profitable cryptocurrencies to invest in 2023.

Bitcoin – most adopted cryptocurrency with huge potential as supply dwindles.

Bitcoin is one of the market's most stable and profitable cryptocurrencies today. Despite multiple bull and bear cycles, a smoothed curve for bitcoin shows that it has been on an upward trajectory since it launched.

When bitcoin was first introduced in 2009, very few people knew about cryptographic currencies. This gave early investors a chance to buy bitcoin at extremely low prices. It was relatively easy to obtain bitcoin simply by connecting a basic gpu to your desktop computer.

Things have changed over the years though. By late 2021, bitcoin was trading highs of $69k. However, following bitcoin's high point in late 2021, its value dropped significantly to lows near $19,000. Despite this fluctuation, however, there is no doubt that the unprecedented growth witnessed by bitcoin since its inception is a powerful testament to the compelling nature of this emerging technology.

At current prices, even if bitcoin were just to retest its most recent highs, it would give investors an incredible return on investment. Potentially up to 2x its current value.

The indicators are that bitcoin is a top cryptocurrency to consider adding to your watchlists in 2023. For starters, adoption is on a growth trajectory. For instance, despite the bear market, the number of institutional investors taking up bitcoin is on a growth trajectory. Given that bitcoin has a hard-capped supply of only 21 million coins, this growing investment signals bitcoin's viability as a cryptocurrency to buy.

Decentraland – metaverse cryptocurrency with a fast-growing gaming ecosystem

Decentraland is one of the best metaverse cryptocurrencies in the market today. This means that having dropped more than 70 per cent off its most recent all-time highs, there is a huge opportunity for gains.

Decentraland is a virtual world unlike any other. Built on top of the ethereum blockchain, it allows users to freely explore its vast expanse, commune with other residents, and interact with an infinite array of digital content. Unlike many other virtual worlds, decentraland holds tremendous potential for developers who want to build immersive 3d experiences.

As a decentralised platform that places content ownership in the hands of users, decentraland enables creators to easily deploy dynamic and interactive digital spaces that seamlessly blend the physical and digital worlds. With thousands of prospects for innovation and limitless opportunities for interaction and enrichment, decentraland presents a bold glimpse into the future of the metaverse.

The best part is that users' virtual assets on the decentraland can be sold as nfts. Users can then store nfts in a cryptocurrency exchange of their choice or sell them. With nfts expected to gain traction going into the future, decentraland stands out as a top cryptocurrency to invest in.

How we identify profitable cryptocurrencies to invest in today

Since the bear market began, most cryptocurrencies have lost significant value and seen widespread price fluctuations. While this may seem scary to many investors, it is important to remember that these fluctuations are normal in the volatile world of cryptos. That's why deciding on potentially profitable cryptocurrencies to invest in can be a challenging endeavor. Many factors must be considered, including a cryptocurrency's technical foundations, potential use cases, and long-term viability.

Additionally, investors must often navigate confusing or contradictory information from nascent crypto communities and must stay up-to-date with the latest developments in this rapidly evolving market. Ultimately, successfully navigating through all of these challenges will require patience and a deep understanding of the cryptocurrency space as a whole. But for those who can successfully navigate these rough waters, investing in good crypto projects has the potential to yield tremendous rewards.

You don't have to worry though. In the section below, we take through the procedure we have taken to choose the most profitable cryptocurrency to invest in 2023. You can use the same techniques to choose high-potential cryptocurrencies you can invest in going into the future.

Consider the idea behind the cryptocurrency and its roadmap

When looking for the best cryptocurrency to invest in, one of the most important factors is the underlying concept and vision behind the project. This includes not only understanding what problem the project aims to address, but also evaluating how realistic its goals and targets are. A good indicator of a promising project is a clear, well-developed roadmap outlining specific goals that are designed to be achieved within a set period.

Another critical step is to thoroughly research the technical details of each potential investment, as this can help determine which projects have strong development teams with significant experience in blockchain technology. In short, when searching for the most profitable cryptocurrency, it is crucial to go beyond simple token performance metrics and look at everything from concept and roadmap targets to technological viability and team experience.

For instance, ethereum has been such a huge success because the idea of creating a decentralised world computer was powerful. Similarly, if you use the same approach to scout for cryptocurrencies, you are likely to find a profitable cryptocurrency to buy in 2023.

Look for hugely undervalued and fundamentally strong cryptocurrencies

One of the best ways to find profitable cryptocurrencies is to look for fundamentally strong cryptocurrencies that have seen a huge drop in valuation. During market downturns like the one we are experiencing now, many cryptocurrencies lose significant value as investors bail out and cash out their positions.

By looking for promising coins that have experienced significant losses, you can often get in on these projects at discounted rates and potentially reap big gains when their valuations eventually rise again. Some key factors to consider when researching potential investments include the project's active development community, future roadmap milestones, and overall popularity among crypto enthusiasts. With time, patience, and a bit of luck, choosing good picks from the sea of struggling cryptocurrencies could lead to profitability.

For instance, bitcoin is without a doubt one of the fundamentally strongest cryptocurrencies in the market today. An investor can record huge profits by capitalising on its ups and downs. After the crash of 2018, bitcoin dropped from over $20k to a low of $3000. Investors that capitalised on this dip benefited immensely when bitcoin hit a high of $69,000 in 2021.

Similarly, by buying bitcoin at its current lows of under $20k, it could emerge as a top profitable cryptocurrency in 2023, even by just retesting its most recent highs.

Consider the token distribution

There is no denying the fact that investing in cryptocurrency can be a profitable venture. However, finding the right coin to invest in isn't always easy. One effective way to identify profitable cryptocurrencies is to assess the number of people who hold the token in question. A high holder count indicates that many people have an interest in that particular coin and its potential for growth. Therefore, by focusing on tokens with high holder counts, investors can increase their chances of finding profitable investments and outperforming the market as a whole.

In most cases, cryptocurrencies, where all the coins are concentrated in only a few wallets, tend to be pump-and-dump schemes or even outright scams. That's because the few accounts that hold all the tokens have a lot of influence on what happens to the cryptocurrency.

Consider its price action in previous bear markets

Many of the most popular cryptocurrencies today are relatively new, having launched in the past few years. These up-and-coming projects tend to experience rapid growth in price and user base, but they also face an increased risk of adversely affecting a bear market.

On the other hand, older cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, dogecoin, and ethereum have already endured multiple bear markets to date, making them somewhat more resilient to total collapse even after market downturns. By virtue of their longevity and proven track record, these cryptocurrencies may be considered less risky investments and thus better positioned for long-term growth.

Furthermore, their numerous use cases and strong community support also recommend them as solid investment opportunities for those looking to capitalise on the continued momentum of this exciting new technology. in short, while new cryptocurrencies may offer higher returns in good times, experienced projects like bitcoin offer greater stability in the long run.

As such, if you are looking for a profitable cryptocurrency to invest in right now that is also relatively safe, it is important to consider past price action.

When is the best time to buy profitable cryptocurrencies?

Buy during bear markets

When it comes to investing in cryptocurrencies, timing is everything. During extended bear market conditions, some of the best opportunities to buy can be found in top digital currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum. These tokens often trade at steeply discounted prices during these downtrends, and those that bought in early have been able to enjoy enormous profits when prices eventually recover.

Additionally, major regulatory developments tend to occur during these times of uncertainty, which creates new opportunities for investors who are poised and ready to take action. So, if you're looking for profitable cryptocurrencies to buy in 2023, the current bear market conditions are the perfect time to start buying.

As long as you stay calm, patient, and strategic with your investments, there's no reason why you can't profit from this exciting and ever-changing market explosion.

Buy during presales

There are many different strategies for buying cryptocurrencies, and one of the most effective is participating in the presale of a new token. Unlike buying during a coin's public offering, where prices may be driven up by speculation and hype, participating in a project's presale typically offers a much more favorable price point. This is because investors who buy during the presale are taking on greater risk since they are helping the team raise the capital they need to launch their project.

In addition, those who buy early often have the opportunity to earn bonus tokens or extra rewards if they agree to lock their investment into their wallet for some time after the sale has concluded. Overall, purchasing coins during a project's presale can be an excellent way to invest in promising cryptocurrencies and potentially reap great returns over time.

Just to give you an idea of how big presales can be, consider that in its ico, ethereum was trading at $0.30. Ethereum has since become one of the most profitable cryptocurrencies ever, even hitting a high of $4800 in 2022.

The meme coin is worth $0.1351 after gaining 130% in seven days.

Six weeks back, DOGE traded at a measly $0.06156, with a market value of $8 billion.

After Elon Musk’s last week’s takeover of the social networking platform Twitter, investor appetite for the most popular meme token has skyrocketed significantly.

Data available on the market tracking website CoinMarketCap shows that Dogecoin (DOGE) has flipped Cardano (ADA) to become the eighth most prominent cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization.

The meme coin currently trades at $0.1351, with over 60% appreciation in the previous 24 hours, putting its seven-day cumulative performance above 130%. Exactly six weeks ago, Coin Edition reported that DOGE had surpassed (DOT) to be the tenth-largest cryptocurrency by market share. At the time, DOGE traded at a measly $0.06156, with a market value barely above $8 billion.

Interestingly, current data from the market shows the DOGE meme token gained over 100% of its value in a month. The current market value of DOGE and ADA are over $18 and $14 billion, respectively, with DOGE leading by over four billion. Notably, DOGE claimed the $4 billion increase over Cardano within 24 hours.

Another interesting fact is that the trading volume of DOGE over ADA within the last 24 hours is over 140% apart. While nearly $15 billion worth of buying and selling happened with the meme token, ADA’s 24-hour trading volume is below $1 million. Nonetheless, the Cardano token’s performance within the previous seven days has been impressive, with over 19% gains.

The crypto market, in general, has been bullish since last week, with BTC gaining over 9%. (ETH) was the second-best performer in the market after DOGE, with over 25% in seven days. Ethereum is worth $1,635, the highest value seven weeks after its blockchain migrated to the efficient proof-of-stake consensus.

Dogecoin Could Merge with Twitter

Charles Hoskinson Cardano’s founder has predicted that, with Twitter in Musk’s hands, Dogecoin would soon be integrated into the social network platform.

2022-10-31 05:48:03.814845,Yahoo Finance,Dogecoin Futures Rack Up Nearly $90M in Liquidations Over Weekend in Unusual Move,"Dogecoin trading over the weekend saw the shiba inu-themed memecoin reach a market capitalization of over $10 billion, add over 90% in value over the past week and become one of the largest liquidators among futures that track crypto majors.

Dogecoin futures racked up over $89 million in liquidations since Friday amid volatile trading as Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter was confirmed. Some $52 million of those figures originated from short traders, or bets against a token’s price rise.

Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).

Dogecoin liquidations were the highest among all cryptocurrencies in the past 24 hours at over $27 million. Futures tracking ether and bitcoin, which usually see the largest figures, racked up a relatively lesser $14 million and $12 million in losses respectively.

The liquidations may have contributed to a short squeeze, as dogecoin prices doubled from nearly 7 cents on Friday to over 15 cents on Sunday morning. Prices retreated to 11 cents on Monday at writing time.

There’s some $647 billion of open interest on dogecoin futures as of Monday. Open interest, or the number of contracts outstanding and not yet liquidated by an offsetting trade.

Elsewhere, on-chain transactions on Dogecoin spiked from 25,000 per day last week to over 37,000 as of Monday morning, data from block explorers show.

Musk has been a major supporter of DOGE, which has become a proxy for sentiment about him.

Additionally, the IRCI report showed that 28.8% of Austrailians owned cryptocurrencies as of December 2021.

Crypto Adoption in Australia

A Independent Reserve Cryptocurrency Index (IRCI) report, IRCI Australia 2021 states that the ownership of crypto assets rose rapidly by a massive 56% in 2021. 28.8% of Australians said they have owned cryptocurrency, up from 18.4% in 2020.

The following index report was prepared while engaging leading consumer research institutions PureProfile to conduct a cross-sectional survey to gauge Austrailian’s crypto adoption with more than 2,000 Austrailians.

On the other hand, the annual inflation rate in the country is the highest in over 32 years as the annual inflation rate has reached 7.3% in Q3 of 2022. Additionally, on the quarterly basis, the consumer price reached up 1.8%, following the same pace of Q2 that remained the steepest pace since the introduction of the Goods and Service Tax as compared to consensus of 1.6%.

Cryptocurrency Adoption Index in Australia

According to Finder’s Cryptocurrency Adoption Index, October 2022 report, 4.1 Million of Australians own crypto, in which 61% of the crypto owners have Bitcoin. While, Aussie’s men seem 1.5x more likely than women to adopt cryptocurrency.

Why It Matters: While the two largest coins, Bitcoin and Ethereum, were in the red, the rise in Dogecoin continued unabated.

The meme coin has shot up a whopping 103.85%, buoyed by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ) CEO Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter, in the last seven days. In the same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have risen 5.3% and 16.5%, respectively.

Dogecoin’s 24-hour trading volume declined 35.76% to $8.03 billion at the time of writing. Coinglass data indicated that $27.58 million worth of DOGE was liquidated over 24 hours.

On Sunday evening, the two cryptocurrencies with the largest market cap were seen trading in negative territory with other major risk assets like stocks. U.S. stock futures were marginally in the red.

This week, investors will be on the lookout for the latest policy meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve which commences Tuesday.

Going forward into the fresh trading week, there has been a marked improvement in investor sentiment. Alternative.me’s “Crypto Fear & Greed Index” was seen pointing to “Fear” at the time of writing.

The index showed a value of 31, last week it was at “22” and flashed “Extreme Fear.” A value of 0 on the measure is construed as “Extreme Fear,” while 100 is “Extreme Greed.”

DOGE has surged by 120% in the last 7 days and Shiba Inu has moved higher by 31% as well. Other digital currencies such as Binance Coin (BNB) and Cardano (ADA) have also moved higher by over 15% during the same period of time.

Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Skyrocket as Elon Musk Takes Over Twitter

Elon Musk has started a new bullish period of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu as these two virtual currencies registered massive gains in recent days. At the end of last week, Elon Musk closed a deal to take over Twitter and some changes are already visible on the social media network.

Elon Musk has been a key supporter of Dogecoin over the last few years. He is considered to be one of the most influential figures in the crypto market, and his declarations, have many times moved the market, affecting especially DOGE. Investors in the crypto market are now waiting for further integrations between Twitter and DOGE or even Bitcoin.

Nevertheless, Bitcoin has lagged behind altcoins during the last 7 days. For example, the digital currency has moved higher just by 8.5% during this time. This shows that market players are paying close attention to what is happening with DOGE and Shiba Inu (or other digital assets) rather than on Bitcoin. These are usually speculative moves that help short-term investors bet on the price movement of DOGE and SHIB.

Dogecoin has now reached a price per coin of $0.1297 per coin and a market capitalization of $18 billion, surpassing Cardano, Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC). This shows the strength that DOGE gained in recent days. At the same time, if it continues to move higher, we could see DOGE surpassing Binance USD (BUSD) and XRP.

While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are more related to social media trends and forum discussions (for example during the GameStop market manipulation in early 2021) than to fundamentals. Despite that, there are some positive things to mention about DOGE and SHIB. Dogecoin could get integrated into different Twitter solutions if Elon Musk decides to bring crypto to Twitter.

There will be a prioritization of DOGE rather than Bitcoin, which could bring additional flows to Dogecoin in the near future. The case for SHIB being used at Twitter is more limited though. SHIB usually follows DOGE’s trend but tends to lag behind with a few exceptions. Therefore, the market should be ready to see volatility in altcoins, especially DOGE and SHIB in the coming months.

Bitcoin, instead, is more correlated to macro economic trends linked to central banking and traditional finance. These are two different types of assets (BTC and DOGE), which require different analytical frameworks to understand what could happen to them. One thing is clear, if Bitocin moves higher, then other altcoins follow most of the times. At the time of writing this article, Bitcoin is being traded at close to $20,850 and it has a market capitalization of $400 billion.","Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), the two largest “meme coins” in the crypto market have skyrocketed in recent hours.

2022-10-31 08:48:04.156194,Watcher Guru,"Has XRP been faring better than Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin?","The past week has been pretty monotonous for the sixth largest crypto asset. Post noting a negligible 0.89% incline, XRP’s price has been stuck around the same level where it was 7-days ago.

Contrastingly, Bitcoin and Ethereum have rallied by 6.2% and 18.5% on the weekly. Dogecoin, on the other hand, has appreciated by a whooping 101% in the same time frame.

On the on-chain front, XRP was the sixth most active chain at press time. All the other networks of the aforementioned cryptos, along with Cardano and Litecoin, stood higher than XRP.

After more than $430 million in volume on its blockchain over the past 24 hours, XRP made $431 via fee. The number was around double for Litecoin, while others reaped even more.

Alongside, the number of active XRP addresses have also been hovering around a level as low as 50k. Simply put, an address is considered to be active when it becomes a direct participant in a successful transaction. The said metric, evidently, shares a direct correlation to the price, and its current underwhelming state is perhaps one of the reasons why the asset’s price has not been able to take off.

Schwartz further went on to highlight that Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP were trading at $47k, $3.7k and $0.85 at the beginning of year. From the said levels, the respective assets’ prices are roughly 56%, 57%, and 45% down, leaving XRP in a comparatively less devastated state.

Maybe if you cherry-pick timeframes, but it seems to me that it mostly does the same things every other cryptocurrency does.

1/1/2022: BTC:$47K ETH:$3,770 XRP:$0.85

Today: BTC:$20.8K ETH:$1,620 XRP:$0.47

2022-10-31 04:48:04.160372,Go Iowa Awesome,2022-23 WBB Preview: The Big Ten,"With a #4 preseason ranking and a non-conference schedule filled with big opponents, Iowa is hoping to build towards a more successful March. But a key component of Iowa’s resume will be its Big Ten performance.

Last year, Iowa finished the season on a huge run and earned a share of the regular season Big Ten title. The Hawkeyes then won three games in three days to capture the Big Ten Tournament. Will Iowa be able to repeat that success this year?

The first thing to note is that the top six teams in the Big Ten are very good. Each is ranked in the preseason Top 25, and each could compete for a Sweet 16 or better. But after the Top 6, things really fall off.

Charlie Creme only projects those 6 Big Ten teams to make the NCAA Tournament, and no other Big Ten team is in the First or Next 4 out. Maybe one or more of the bottom eight teams will take a step, but for now there is a huge gap between the top and bottom of the conference.

#11 Indiana

The Hoosiers were arguably the second-best team in the conference last year, and return two All-Conference players in Grace Berger and Mackenzie Holmes. They were also active in the transfer portal, adding one of the best shooters in the country in Sarah Scalia, a former 5-star recruit in Sydney Parrish, and a solid forward in Alyssa Geary.

The preseason expectations are for Indiana to be as good or better than last year, but I’m not so sure. The Hoosiers lost three seniors—Ali Patberg, Aleksa Gulbe, and Nicole Cardano-Hillary—who were very important to the team’s success. Cardano-Hillary was the team’s best perimeter defender and guarded Caitlin Clark closely in each of their three matchups. Patberg was in her 7th season, and ran the offense well at point guard. And Gulbe did basically everything well.

I think Indiana’s offense will be better than last year, but its defense will be worse. And the Hoosiers don't have a natural point guard among their top players. I still think Indiana will be one of the best teams in the conference, but I think last year’s team fit together better.

#14 Ohio State

The Buckeyes have arguably the best back court in the country. Jacy Sheldon and Taylor Mikesell are both All-Big Ten players, and they attack the basket and shoot the three as well as anyone. They also see guard Madison Greene return after being out last season with an injury.

Like last year, Ohio State’s biggest questions are at the forward positions and on defense. Ohio State doesn’t have a great post presence, and like Iowa they prefer to outscore teams than to win games on the defensive end.

Aided by a favorable conference schedule, the Buckeyes split the regular season conference championship with Iowa last year. This year, they will look to repeat that and to improve their NCAA Tournament seeding. I think they will be Iowa’s biggest competition in the conference.

#17 Maryland

I expected Maryland to be one of the Top 5 teams in the country last year. Instead, injuries and chemistry issues led them to finish 23-9 and lose in the Sweet Sixteen. That’s a great season for most teams, but not for Maryland and not with the expectations the Terrapins had entering the season.

Things got worse in the offseason, as Angel Reese and Ashley Owusu—two of the most talented players in the country—transferred to other schools. Key role player Mimi Collins also transferred, and Coach Brenda Frese shared details about her transfer that she really shouldn’t have.

But just when it looked like Maryland might take a significant step back, Frese dipped into the transfer portal, adding Abby Meyers, Lavender Briggs, Elisa Pinzan, Allie Kubek, and Brinae Alexander, who all did well at their prior schools.

The Terps also still have Diamond Miller, one of the top players in the conference, and Shyanne Sellers, an athletic sophomore who will likely build on a strong freshman season last year.

So where does that leave Maryland? I’m not entirely sure. Frese is one of the top coaches in the country, but she has also lost a ton of talent to the transfer portal in recent years. Can Frese get a bunch of new pieces to fit together, or will chemistry issues continue to make Maryland underperform?

Of all the top teams, I think Maryland is the most volatile. I wouldn’t be surprised if the Terps challenge for a conference title. I also wouldn’t be totally shocked if they finish the season outside the Top 25.

#22 Nebraska

It pains me to say this, but Nebraska is a really fun team. Like Iowa, they play fast, shoot a ton of threes, and score a lot of points. Jaz Shelley is one of the best guards in the conference, and Alexis Markowski was the conference’s best freshman last year. The Huskers also return many of their best role players.

They finished 24-9 and 11-7 in conference last season. I expect them to be better this year. If they can improve their defense and limit their scoring droughts, they might well compete for a Top 4 spot in the conference.

#25 Michigan

This year’s Michigan team reminds me a lot of Iowa’s 2019-2020 team. As a refresher, the 2019-2020 Iowa team was coming off an Elite Eight appearance, but also lost arguably the best player in school history in Megan Gustafson. It returned many of the key role players from that Elite Eight team, though, and the future in recruiting was bright. The expectations for that Iowa team were low, but it outperformed them, and was on pace for a Top 4 seed in the NCAA Tournament before the Tournament was cancelled due to COVID.

Michigan is coming off an Elite Eight appearance, but needs to replace Naz Hillmon, arguably the best player in school history. The Wolverines return a bunch of role players from that Elite Eight team, but their expectations are relatively low—I have seen some predictions that they will be a bubble team this year. The future of the team also looks bright with some key recruiting commitments.

I don’t expect Michigan to be quite as good as the 2019-2020 Iowa team, but I do think they will easily make the NCAA Tournament and be competitive with the top teams in the conference.

Purdue

At the beginning of last season, Purdue looked like it was arguably in the worst position of any team in the Big Ten. The Boilermakers' longtime coach decided to retire early amidst scandal. Most of their top players transferred in the previous off-season. And new coach Katie Gearlds' only previous head coaching experience was at NAIA Marian.

Purdue went 16-14 overall last year and 7-11 in the Big Ten. That was good for a tie for 9th in the conference. This year, the Boilermakers return most of their top players. They might well be the best team outside of the Top 6 and might even compete for an NCAA Tournament bid.

Northwestern

Northwestern plays an aggressive zone defense that focuses on turning teams over. That has given Iowa fits the last two seasons. It also helped the Wildcats make the second round of the NCAA Tournament two years ago. Last year, they were on the NCAA Tournament bubble, but just missed making the tournament.

This year’s Northwestern squad returns four of its top six players, but it loses Veronica Burton, who was drafted #7 overall in the WNBA Draft and played in 36 games for the Dallas Wings.

Now the Wildcats look to return to the NCAA Tournament without their star player. I’m skeptical that they'll be able to accomplish that, though I wouldn’t be surprised if Northwestern pulled a couple upsets throughout the season.

Michigan State

Michigan State is very similar to Northwestern. The Spartans were on the NCAA Tournament bubble for a while last year, before fading down the stretch. The Spartans are a good bet to finish in the middle of the conference, though, as they have finished between 7th and 9th in each of the last five seasons.

There is some optimism that results can improve this year. The Spartans dealt with a number of injuries last year, but return many of their top players. Like Northwestern, though, Michigan State also has to replace its top player. Nia Clouden was one of the best players in the conference last year, but was drafted #12 overall in the WNBA Draft and played in 28 games for the Connecticut Sun.

Like Northwestern, I’m skeptical they will return to the tournament without their best player from last year.

Minnesota

Lindsay Whalen is the Scott Frost of women’s basketball. Former player who led their school to glory and is universally loved by the fanbase? Check. A hire that seemed like a home run when it was announced? Check. A team that wildly underperformed expectations in the coach’s first few seasons? Check. The coach’s future largely dependent on a single class of players? Check again.

Whalen went 60-57 in her first four years at Minnesota, but her conference record was just 28-44. For comparison, Coach Marlene Stallings went 82-47 overall and 38-30 in conference in her four seasons at Minnesota before Whalen took over. Stallings made the NCAA Tournament twice. Whalen hasn’t made one NCAA Tournament appearance. And her results have arguably gotten worse every year.

Last year Iowa beat Minnesota 105-49 in Minneapolis, and it looked like a low point for the program. Then things got worse in the off-season, as most of Minnesota’s top players transferred. There was a brief point in time before the freshman arrived that Minnesota only had a few players on its roster.

So why does Whalen still have a job? Well, aside from how tough it would be to fire the program’s best-ever player, Whalen did just bring in the best recruiting class in program history. Had Minnesota fired her this off-season, it might have risked those players changing their commitments to another school.

Still, Whalen and Minnesota have a lot riding on the next season or two. If the results don’t improve, Whalen will be out of a job, and Minnesota might have a significant rebuild ahead.

Penn State

Last year Penn State had one of the conference’s best scorers in Makenna Marisa, but went 11-18 overall and 5-13 in conference. Marisa is back this year, along with promising sophomore Leiani Kapinus. The Nittany Lions also brought in a few transfers that might help.

Coach Carolyn Kieger is entering her fourth season, though, and she’s 12-43 in conference. If Penn State doesn’t show decent improvement this season, Kieger might be looking for another job.

Wisconsin

Wisconsin went 8-21 overall and 5-13 in Big Ten play last year, and frankly that was a success. The Badgers were the worst team in the Big Ten in 2020-2021, and brought in Coach Marisa Moseley to begin a big rebuild. The Badgers have most of their top players back from last year, so the question now is can they build toward a middle of the conference finish?

Rutgers

Rutgers used the transfer portal earlier than most teams in the Big Ten. For a few years, it helped the Scarlet Knights supplement their roster and helped them make a few NCAA Tournament appearances. But last season Rutgers had to remake its roster through the portal after a few graduations and transfers.

It’s safe to say that didn’t work. Rutgers went 11-20 overall and just 3-14 in the Big Ten. Then to make things worse, legendary coach C. Vivian Stringer announced her retirement after the season.

Rutgers brought in Coquese Washington to replace Stringer. Coach Washington spent the past two seasons as an assistant coach at Notre Dame, but was Penn State’s coach from 2007-2019. In that time, she made four NCAA Tournaments, two Sweet Sixteens, and won the Big Ten three times. But she also struggled significantly in her final five seasons at Penn State, finishing 11th or worse in the conference in four of those seasons.

The Scarlet Knights only have 8 players listed on their roster right now, and two of those players are freshman, so it might be a long season in Piscattaway.

Illinois

Coach Nancy Fahey’s five years at Illinois went about as poorly as they possibly could have. The Illini went 42-99 in that time, and were a horrible 7-77 in the Big Ten. And it’s not like they had a ton of success before her. The Illini's last NCAA Tournament appearance was in 2003.

But Illinois does have renewed hope in the form of a new coach. Shauna Green (born in Clinton, IA) joins the program after six very successful seasons with Dayton in which she won the Atlantic 10 five times and made four NCAA Tournament appearances.

The bottom of the Big Ten was brutal last year, but Illinois was a step below the rest. Any finish above dead last would be good for Coach Green in her first season.","Last year, Iowa finished the season on a huge run and earned a share of the regular season Big Ten title.

The MOU, signed by the Thai Fintech Association (TFA) and the Hungarian Blockchain Coalition on Oct. 25, will see the two associations “share experiences, best practices and explore areas potentially beneficial for direct cooperation,” according to a Facebook post by the Embassy of Hungary in Bangkok.

TFA president Chonladet Khemarattana said that e-commerce, mobile payments, and digital currencies are growing rapidly in Thailand and that international cooperation is needed to further develop local financial technology, according to an Oct. 29 report from the Bangkok Post.

He also claimed 20% of the world’s crypto holders are in Thailand, the country placed eighth on the 2022 Global Crypto Adoption Index released in September by analytics firm Chainalysis and crypto payments company TripleA estimates almost 6.5% of the population owns cryptocurrency,

The Hungarian Blockchain Coalition was jointly created by the country’s Ministry of Innovation and Technology and the National Data and Economy Knowledge Centre in March 2022, while the Thai Fintech Association is a nonprofit founded in 2016 with the aim of representing the local financial technology industry including cryptocurrency exchanges.

The pact comes as Thailand’s central bank, along with some of the country’s commercial banks, were involved in the testing of a cross-border wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) transaction platform using distributed ledger technology in September.

The Bank of Thailand also announced in August it was looking to start a pilot of a retail CBDC by the end of 2022 at a limited scale in the private sector among roughly 10,000 users. It would test the digital currency using “cash-like activities” such as paying for goods or services.

Meanwhile, Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has enacted some restrictions on crypto this year, with it banning the use of cryptocurrencies for payments in March, saying they “could affect the stability of the financial system.”

The regulator is also cracking down on crypto lending platforms, with the SEC planning to prohibit crypto exchanges from providing or supporting digital asset depository services.

Hungary seemingly takes a similar hard stance on cryptocurrencies. In February, the governor of the Hungarian National Bank, György Matolcsy, wanted a blanket ban on all crypto trading and mining across the European Union, saying it “serviced illegal activities” and was “speculative.”","The financial technology associations for Thailand and Hungary have signed a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to support the introduction of blockchain technology to their respective financial sectors.

In a recent thread, controversial YouTuber Ben Armstrong (a.k.a. “BitBoy”) has addressed his unflattering comments about the XRP community.

Armstrong, who has now positioned himself as one of the biggest cheerleaders of the Ripple-affiliated cryptocurrency, called its supporters “delusional” in a newly resurfaced video clip for lacking fundamental understanding of the market.

In the video, Armstrong mocked outlandish price predictions that were being promoted by some members of the community.

After receiving some pushback from XRP fans, Armstrong has now walked back on his comments. “Fact is, people are capable of getting new information and then changing their minds,” he wrote.

He then suggests that XRP has managed to mature over the past few years, which prompted him to change his opinion.

Last week, the controversial YouTuber said that he wasn’t going to buy meme coin Dogecoin , which recently experienced a massive price spike because of the Twitter news.

Earlier this October, Armstrong predicted that Cardano would end up surpassing Ethereum in a few years from now.

As reported by U.Today , Ledger co-founder Eric Larchevêque recently faced backlash from the XRP community after claiming that the cryptocurrency was centralized. In fact, Larchevêque said that XRP wasn’t even a cryptocurrency.

2022-10-31 09:48:04.469571,MakeUseOf,The 5 Best Crypto IRAs to Use for Your Retirement,"One eye on the future? Everyone should, really.

Cryptocurrencies are available to a wide range of investors, and there are now several ways to invest.

One such option is a Bitcoin IRA, which allows investors to buy and trade the asset using an established IRA platform ahead of their retirement. The following are the best crypto IRAs you can use to invest in Bitcoin against your retirement.

MakeUseOf Video of the Day

1. BitcoinIRA

BitcoinIRA is by far the most popular crypto IRA available. You can trade on the platform 24/7, making it possible to trade whenever you wish.

BitcoinIRA supports over 60 crypto assets, including Bitcoin, of course, and many top altcoins, such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and Cardano.

With just $3,000, you can open an IRA account and buy and start trading a single cryptocurrency or multiple cryptocurrencies of any combination.

You can also roll over other retirement funds such as traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, SEP IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs, 403b, or 401k into your BitcoinIRA account and keep trading.

BitcoinIRA works with crypto custodial services provider, BitGo to securely hold your crypto assets in offline cold storage, making it safe from attackers even if the platform is compromised.

What's more? A $700 million insurance policy covers your retirement investment should anything go wrong.

Apart from a one-time fee used to cover security, storage, and other costs, there are specific fees that BitcoinIRA doesn't state explicitly. You'll need to speak with an agent to get specific numbers, depending on how you want to structure your account.

2. BitIRA

BitIRA is one of the top crypto IRAs you should consider before retirement. Like BitcoinIRA, it supports several crypto assets for you to choose from, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.

You'll need a minimum of $5,000 to invest in this one, and you can invest in any number of the supported crypto assets. BitIRA's fees include $195 for annual maintenance, 0.05% of invested amount as a custody fee, and a one-time $50 setup fee, in addition to variable transaction fees.

For security, BitIRA employs cold storage with Equity Trust Company to securely provide custody for users' funds while giving them complete control of their assets. There's also a $100 million insurance cover for your funds in case of any misfortunes.

3. CoinIRA

CoinIRA provides a platform for investing in a single or multiple cryptocurrencies. It supports at least 20 assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Supported accounts include traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, SEP IRAs, and SIMPLE IRAs.

One thing that sets CoinIRA apart is that in addition to its crypto assets, it also provides a crypto IRA guide to help you better understand your investment. They also provide consultants to help answer any questions concerning your investment.

Also noteworthy is the fact that CoinIRA doesn't charge custody fees, even though Equity Trust Company is its crypto custodian, just like BitIRA. Instead, you'll need to pay a 1.25% buy transaction fee and a 1% sell transaction fee when trading.

There is no startup or maintenance fee, but the minimum initial investment is $5,000, which may be on the high side for some investors.

4. Regal Assets

Regal Assets is known for providing variety for its IRA account holders. Apart from cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin (and many others, with 22 in total), it also provides hard assets such as gold and silver.

Regal Assets started initially as a platform purely dedicated to precious metals. It only included cryptocurrencies in 2017, when the demand for cryptocurrencies started to soar.

Like the other IRA platforms, it uses offline storage to secure customers' assets, for which you'll pay $150 yearly for the storage and a $100 annual administrative fee.

You can sign up on Regal Assets and start with an initial investment or rollover your traditional IRA account into it. If your favorite crypto asset isn't among the listed 22, Regal Assets has an on-demand request for such a situation, and you can call to make a special request.

The major downside of this platform are the huge fees it charges for account maintenance and administration, but you can enjoy the variety that only a few platforms like it offer.

5. iTrustCapital

iTrustCapital is a reputable platform for crypto IRA investing and one that is more affordable than most. The platform is friendly towards both beginners and experienced investors alike, giving everyone a chance to experiment with a crypto IRA account.

If you're just starting out in crypto investing, it may be helpful to research which altcoins to invest in first.

With a minimum investment of just $1,000, iTrustCapital lowers the bar for crypto IRA investing for retirement to those with lower capital. Like Regal Assets, you can buy and trade crypto and hard assets, such as gold and silver, in real-time, using your retirement account on iTrustCapital.

There are over 25 cryptocurrencies to choose from, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins that you can trade at any time of the day, 24/7. There are no monthly or annual account maintenance fees, and the transaction fee for crypto is 1% flat. The transaction fee for gold is $50 per ounce, while silver is $2.50 per ounce.

Assets on iTrustCapital are covered with insurance of up to $370 million in collaboration with Coinbase Custody, the custodial services arm of Coinbase, one of America's best crypto exchanges.

The downside is that you can only fund your account with USD before buying crypto, as direct funding with crypto from another wallet is not allowed.

If you're looking for a low-cost platform to start your crypto IRA with just $1,000 and access digital and hard assets at an affordable cost, iTrustCapital may be the place for you.

However, that move appears to be breaking down as a clear double-top formation has been printed on the charts.

The pattern has been identified by leading analysts this morning, with Lark Davis noting that volume has also been falling throughout the move.

Bitcoin Bears Back in Play

Davis noted that support was at the $19K region, where the asset has been consolidating for most of October. There simply isn’t enough momentum and demand to drive prices higher at the moment and the macroeconomic outlook is still grim.

Crypto analyst and trader “il Capo” told his 570K followers that the downsides could be even worse, with a potential bottom of $14K in November.

This scenario would mirror the final flush out in the 2018 bear market that sent Bitcoin prices crashing over 50% to hit a bottom of $3,200 in November.

Fellow trader and analyst “Rekt Capital” zoomed out to look at the larger picture. He said that a bearish monthly close would take place if Bitcoin closed below the green $20K support zone. This would be the second consecutive monthly close below $20K, he added.

“And seeing as $BTC lost the green-red range in Sept, such a close could set BTC up for bearish continuation,”

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading down 1% on the day at $20,553 during the Monday morning Asian trading session. There is some support at $20,200, but the main level lies at around $19,250.

Elsewhere on Crypto Markets

Total market cap dropped a percentage point overnight and declined to $1.05 trillion, with daily volumes also falling back to around $70 billion, according to CoinGecko.

Ethereum, which peaked at almost $1,650 over the weekend, has declined 1.6% to $1,584. The asset has gained a whopping 16% over the past week but is likely to move in the shadow of its big brother.

Most of the altcoins were either neutral or in the red, with slightly greater losses for Ripple’s XRP, Cardano (ADA), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Uniswap (UNI).

By all accounts, things are shaping up for a bearish November, but on the upside, it could signal the bottom of this market cycle.","Bitcoin tapped a weekend peak of $21,000 on Saturday, its highest price since September 13.

2022-10-31 09:48:04.504955,Bitcoinist,How ChainPort Is Making DeFi Cross-Chain Bridges Safer,"Hacks in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space have become so rampant that they are expected at this point. However, with billions of dollars passing through the industry, it has become imperative to ensure the safety of users through adequate security measures.

Bitcoinist caught up with Erez Ben-Kiki, CEO and Founder of DeFi cross-chain bridge, ChainPort, where he shares thoughts on the current DeFi climate and how ChainPort is ensuring the safety of user funds on its platform.

Bitcoinist: Hello Erez, let’s start by just giving us a brief background of your journey so far in crypto and DeFi

Erez Ben-Kiki: After graduating with a BA in economics, I worked for ten years in the financial sector as an analyst and Nostro manager, and trader. Later I transferred to digital advertising and founded a marketing agency. After falling deep into the crypto rabbit hole, I founded 2key, a project that later became DecentraLab.

Bitcoinist: So how did ChainPort come out of all of this?

Erez Ben-Kiki: Decentralab became a development house that builds various projects and products in the Web3 space. ChainPort is one of Dcentralab’s most prominent products, as well as Hord, TokensFarm, 2Key, and more coming soon.

TokensFarm is a leading Farm-As-A-Service provider; TokensFarm offers fully customized, deployable Vesting, LP, or staking farms that can be live within hours.

Hord is an innovative DeFi protocol that offers tokenized ETFs. Hord includes Viking DAO, Champion’s Pools, and more. Viking DAO is an investment platform where backers can support pools of up to 20 projects and receive a tradable pool token in return. Champions pools allow users to create or follow crypto trading strategies.

2key was the first project that brought Dcentralab together. 2Key offers multi-step link tracking and smart contracts over HTTP protocols via the noble 2key protocol.

ChainPort was born out of necessity. Interoperability is needed to connect different blockchains and facilitate communication and transfer of value between them. While interoperability and bridges are needed, it became evident that security is the “Achilles heel” for most bridges.

The issue is that bridges, like exchanges, are high-stakes platforms that hold enormous amounts of value and can be vulnerable to bugs in their underlying code. Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin mentioned the security risks of bridges on Reddit several months ago. Since then, hundreds of millions of dollars have been stolen in various bridge exploits and hacks.

We spent time trying to solve the security issue that many bridges have, and from this problem came ChainPort, the world’s first ultra-secure custodial bridge.

More than $55 billion are currently locked in DeFi protocols : Source: DefiLlama

Bitcoinist: ChainPort is a cross-chain bridge. Can you tell me how it’s different from other cross-chain bridges?

Erez Ben-Kiki: ChainPort is a cutting-edge cross-chain bridge that offers complete interoperability and custodian-level protection. ChainPort provides a level of security architecture that has never been seen before, reliably transferring tokens between blockchains with only a single click.ChainPort is the only custodial bridge in the world of blockchain. We store 95% of the funds in cold storage wallets provided by leading industry security experts, including FireBlocks MPC and Gnosis-safe multi-sig, to ensure the security of funds.

Users can port tokens in a permissionless manner with ChainPort, and human approval is not required. ChainPort is also a high-speed bridge; tokens can be ported in as fast as 2.5 minutes across chains. Users can also port tokens across multiple blockchains without the need to revert to the original token for each port.

Now, a lot of hacks have happened in DeFi, a good chunk of them being on cross-chain bridges. What are the most common risks with these kinds of DeFi protocols?

When it comes to risks regarding DeFi and specifically bridges, the most significant risk is smart contract risk.



In many recent bridge exploits, the core of the failure was “implicit checksums.” Implicit checksums mean the code relies on an implicit assumption that functions will be called or parameters will be used in a certain way.

Chainport has various checksums and monitoring tools in place to prevent failures. For example, we have a monitoring tool in place that constantly checks that the balance of assets across all our supported chains remains 1:1. Any deviation results in an immediate bridge freeze and can trigger potential rollbacks or manual intervention.



We also ensure all deposited funds are kept safe in cutting-edge multi-signature MPC wallets. So even in a worst-case scenario, funds have multiple layers of protection.

Bitcoinist: So what is ChainPort doing to make sure something like this never happens?



Erez Ben-Kiki: ChainPort brings a unique security architecture, funds segregation being the main one. Only up to 5% of the assets will be in the hot bridge contract, with the remaining 95% + being on rebalancing and treasury vaults. All our custodian wallets are secured by multiple security layers, including Fireblocks MPC and Gnosis multi-sig wallets, the main ones.



On top, ChainPort’s team rigorously tests all code and smart contracts, and they undergo multiple independent audits by blockchain security leaders. ChainPort passed numerous audits by both Certik & Cyber Unit. We’re also in the final stages of an audit with Trail of Bits, one of the top 3 auditors in the world.

We could fairly say that ChainPort today is the safest bridge in the crypto space.

Bitcoinist: Where does DeFi security go from here, do you think? Are DeFi protocols learning from these hacks to prevent future hacks?

Erez Ben-Kiki: Security is a constant game of cat and mouse. Learning as much as possible from every hack is necessary in the world of DeFi. Protocols need to emphasize security as much as possible.



It is almost impossible to be fully protected at all times, as hackers always outnumber you and your team. They will try day and night to hack and steal assets deposited in your product or protocol.



That’s why we took the custodial approach, which allows all parties to rest assured that even if it’s unlikely to happen, the funds are off-chain and fully protected.

These days, we introduce an even safer, more secure premium version of ChainPort, the ChainPort Private Custodian. The service combines ChainPort’s best features with added features and an enhanced custodial security model. The custodial security model shares the multi-sig keys with the project porting tokens and an external lawyer in a ⅗ multi-sig model.

Sharing multi-sig keys across three parties eliminate any single party’s access to the tokens and takes segregation one step forward. Distributing control makes the bridge even more secure and adds an extra layer of safety for tokens. Additional features include setting supported chains, a set path for ports, and setting the minimum or maximum amount of tokens you want to allow users to port are also part of that service.



Bitcoinist: To close, where do you see DeFi in the next five years? More interoperability or less?

Erez Ben-Kiki: Despite the recent market downturn, consumer interest in DeFi and cryptocurrency is still solid. According to Google Trends, the search volume for popular cryptocurrencies is much higher than in 2020. DeFi as an aspect of crypto will continue to grow, with even more novel protocols and chains being developed. As such, interoperability will be necessary, and bridges will be required to facilitate the transfer of information and value. Crypto adoption is most probably here to stay and thrive. Interoperability will be a significant part of the next cycle of growth.



At ChainPort, we’re constantly adding support for more tokens and blockchains to guarantee more interoperability. Just recently, we’ve added support for Fantom and Dogechain. Support for Cardano, Arbitrum, Milkomeda, Solana, and many other chains is also coming soon to ChainPort. With bridges like ChainPort, it is safe to say that we will see much greater interoperability in the next few years.

2022-10-31 11:48:04.506816,Decrypt,Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin: Crypto Industry Shouldn't Be 'Enthusiastically Pursuing Institutional Capital',"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin weighed in Sunday on the regulatory debate surrounding crypto, providing his thoughts on what industry rules should—and should not—include.

Regulation could make crypto more palatable to mainstream financial institutions and legitimize cryptocurrencies as an asset class. But new rules and policies could also alter the industry’s DNA, particularly as it relates to principles like censorship resistance and decentralization.

Buterin said he believes preserving the latter should be the priority.

“I don't think we should be enthusiastically pursuing large institutional capital at full speed,” he said. “Regulation that leaves the crypto space free to act internally but makes it harder for crypto projects to reach the mainstream is much less bad than regulation that intrudes on how crypto works internally.”

Basically, especially at this time, regulation that leaves the crypto space free to act internally but makes it harder for crypto projects to reach the mainstream is much less bad than regulation that intrudes on how crypto works internally. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 30, 2022

Buterin’s Twitter thread comes ten days after a controversial blog post by Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and chief executive of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, in which he outlined his regulatory vision for the industry.

Bankman-Fried subsequently capitulated to Crypto Twitter after receiving pushback on potential rules related to DeFi, such as requiring autonomous programs to comply with U.S. sanctions and making crypto websites register as a broker-dealer. He revised the post and said he will continue to do so.

Regulatory uncertainty is seen as a barrier to institutional crypto investing, according to a new Fidelity Investments survey. The Institutional Investor Digital Assets Study found that out of more than 1,000 institutional investors, 16% said a lack of clarity around regulation was an obstacle to investing in digital assets.

On the other hand, more than 8 in 10 (81%) of the institutional investors surveyed view digital assets as having a role in investment portfolios. In addition, 43% of institutional investors said they would be interested in a Bitcoin ETF.

Segments of the crypto industry have been pursuing institutional capital for almost a decade, ever since the Winklevoss twins’ initial filing for a Bitcoin ETF-like trust in 2013. While futures-based products trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Securities and Exchange Commission has dragged its feet on approving a spot-based Bitcoin ETF.

That’s not a bad thing, according to Buterin.

“I'm actually kinda happy a lot of the ETFs are getting delayed,” he said. “The ecosystem needs time to mature before we get even more attention.”

Another maybe-controversial take of mine is that I don't think we should be enthusiastically pursuing large institutional capital at full speed. I'm actually kinda happy a lot of the ETFs are getting delayed. The ecosystem needs time to mature before we get even more attention. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 30, 2022

Buterin divided the policy goals he envisions for the crypto industry into two categories: providing better protection to consumers who navigate the nascent industry, and stemming the illicit flow of cryptocurrency—which he said are not exclusive to the DeFi space.

To address the latter, Buterin is skeptical of requiring DeFi protocol front-ends to abide by Know Your Customer (KYC) standards. While such standards are used by financial institutions to prevent money laundering, fraud, and corruption, “hackers write custom code to interact with contracts,” circumventing the usual KYC barriers.

“It would annoy users but do nothing against hackers,” he said.

The ""KYC on defi frontends"" idea does not seem very pointful to me: it would annoy users but do nothing against hackers. Hackers write custom code to interact with contracts already. Exchanges are clearly a much more sensible place to do the KYC, and that's happening already. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 30, 2022

There are DeFi regulations that Buterin thinks could be more helpful, such as limits on the amount of leverage a user can trade with, transparency in code audits, and requiring “knowledge-based tests” as opposed to “plutocratic net-worth minimum rules.”

Buterin said he’s also in favor of crafting regulation in a way that allows for the further use of zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic principle that preserves privacy.

The response to the response

SBF responded to Buterin’s points, stating he thinks they “are pretty reasonable” and expressed an openness to bringing the ethereum co-founder to Washington DC in order to give nuanced input on regulation.

“I think that policymakers/regulators would find it pretty interesting to hear from @VitalikButerin,” SBF stated. “he's very different from the average person in DC, but in a kinda refreshing way—calmly and thoughtfully saying what he thinks.”

Buterin’s comments also appeared to receive an endorsement from Changpeng Zhao, founder and chief executive of Binance, another leading cryptocurrency exchange. The CEO responded to the thread with a thumbs up emoji.

Crypto investor Ryan Sean Adams gave a nod to Buterin’s entry into the debate as well, stating Buterin is welcome to share his thoughts at Bankless, a DAO and crypto media project.

Adams had delivered pointed criticism to SBF’s initial blog post, tweeting, “This absolutely sucks.”

2022-10-31 09:48:04.517587,Coindoo,Best Coins to Stake and How to Get Started,"Lately, PoS has been in the crypto world’s public eye more than anything else. And as the trend tends to lean toward staking, we can’t help but look for the best coins to stake.

For blockchain environments, the algorithm securing the network can be a deal maker or a deal breaker. That’s because it shows the earning potential users may have, as well as how secure and performant a network can be.

It’s hard to decide which are the best coins to stake, though. The information is quite dispersed, and the subject looks a little intimidating.

But, if Elon Musk could launch his spaceship out there, you surely can get started with staking. Plus, staking cryptocurrency is nowhere near as complicated as rocket science.

So, let’s see how you can start staking.

What Is Staking in Simpler Words?

The definition and terminology might vary from project to project. Yet, generally speaking, staking is the process within the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism that involves the appointment of a node to validate the next block. Hence, the chosen nodes are called validators.

To become a validator, a node has to deposit a certain number of coins into the network as a stake. In a way, it is similar to a security deposit.

The size of the stake affects a node’s chance to validate the next block. The bigger the stake, the more chances someone has to be chosen as a validator.

Once chosen, the validator checks if the transactions are valid. If there are no issues, the new block is added to the blockchain. Afterward, the validator receives the fees associated with the transactions.

When a node wants to stop being a validator, the staker can simply pull out the coins together with the transaction fees.

What If some Lousy Party Decides to Mess with the Validation Process?

Well, PoS investors thought about that, too.

If a validator does not do their job correctly, they will lose a part of his stake or even all of it.

So, validators can lose a lot more money than they can gain if they misbehave.

Moreover, users can’t unlock their stake straight away as the network first needs to check if a validator should be punished.

Yet, although it seems to be a more efficient and eco-friendly system than Proof of Work, Proof of Stake is a less proven method, and there are quite a few concerns with it. One of them is that the whales are at an obvious advantage.

So, different cryptocurrency networks came up with additional protocols and variations of the PoS.

The coin age selection and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) are some of the most known.

In coin age selection, the number of coins being staked is multiplied by the length of time they have been held for. After validating a block, the coin age is reset to zero, and the validator has to wait a certain period before he can be chosen again.

The DPoS system is maintained through an election process that mainly requires holders to vote for delegates. Delegates are responsible for validating new blocks.

The number of delegates may vary from one network to another. Some networks have a fixed number of delegates that can range between 21 and 101, while others may have an indefinite number.

Each cryptocurrency holder in the network gets several votes that they can use themselves or delegate their stake to another stakeholder on the network to vote on their behalf.

As blocks are produced every few seconds, delegates that attempt to mess with the blockchain’s integrity or fail to constantly make blocks will lose reputation and be expelled and replaced by another delegate.

Top Proof of Stake Coins

Ethereum (ETH)

Ethereum is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market, and it switched from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS). The change is called The Merge, and it helped Ethereum become a promising option for staking.

Simply put, Ethereum is a decentralized software platform basing its activity on blockchain technology. It supports smart contracts, which are essential for decentralized applications to function well.

The Ethereum blockchain is widely used by developers for creating technology based upon it, and it is used in a wide range of industries. Furthermore, crypto investors can receive ETH for completing actions to support the blockchain, and they can pay for some goods and services where crypto payments are accepted.

Ethereum staking rewards change based on how much of the cryptocurrency is staked. Thus, the more ETH is staked, the lower the rewards will be. After The Merge, validators can get an APY (Annual Percentage Yield) of 5%. 3

Thus, if you stake $1000 worth of ETH, you will get a yearly reward of around $50.

CARDANO (ADA)

The second of the best coins to stake in our list is Cardano. In Cardano, staking involves a proof-of-stake algorithm known as Ouroboros. It divides up time into “epochs” that contain 21,600 slots. Slots are short periods in which a block can be created, and they last around 20 seconds.

These epochs are each led by elected slot leaders who are responsible for creating and confirming blocks. The transactions in the blocks created by slot leaders are then approved by input endorsers, chosen based on stakes. There can be more than one input endorser in each epoch.

The rewards given for participating in the Cardano blockchain are split between three stakeholders: input endorsers, multiparty computation stakeholders, and slot leaders.

Through the Shelly incentivized testnet, Cardano allows non-custodial delegation to pools as well as staking pool creation. And as it seems, staking Cardano comes with a 5% average early return. (More details here)

So, for an ADA equivalent of $1,000, you may get a yearly reward of around $50.

Avalanche (AVAX)

Avalanche is a blockchain platform that can process around 4,500 transactions per second (tps), which is significantly more than Ethereum, which stands at around 14 tps. Its native cryptocurrency is called AVAX, and it was launched in 2020.

Avalanche was developed to be a fast, secure, affordable, and accessible open-source project, and it also has a smart contract platform.

AVAX was built to pay transaction processing fees, secure the network, and act as a basic unit of account among Avalanche-based blockchains.

In the Avalanche staking process, there are two types of participants: validators and delegators. While validators secure Avalanche, process transactions, and create new blocks, delegators are those who hold tokens and want to participate in staking but choose to do that through an existing validating node. The process is called “delegation.”

The yearly staking rewards for delegators and validators are quite close, standing at 8.67% and 8.97%, respectively.

So, if you want to stake AVAX as a delegator, you will have a yearly reward of $86.7 for $1000 worth of AVAX staked. On the other hand, if you stake the same amount as a validator, your yearly staking reward will be $89.7.

Solana (SOL)

Solana is a blockchain platform launched in 2017. Its main purpose is to host decentralized, scalable applications. The Solana blockchain can process around 4,000 transactions per second, a great number when compared to Ethereum’s TPS.

Solana’s token (SOL) has a market cap of more than $10 billion (at the time of writing), and it is used for staking and paying fees associated with smart contracts and other transactions. SOL has an APY of around 6%, meaning that for $1000 worth of Solana staked, you will get a yearly reward of approximately $60.

Polkadot (DOT)

Polkadot was founded by Dr. Gavin Wood, Robert Habermeier, and Peter Czaban within the Web3 Foundation.

The goal is to build an ecosystem where different projects can build their projects upon and rely on its security instead of building from the ground up.

The network connects blockchains through a system involving a Relay chain, several shards called parachains, and bridges.

As for the governance system, Polkadot employs a referendum-like method called Referenda. The voting system aims to engage a large part of the community by granting DOT holders voting rights based on their stake.

To become a voter, a DOT holder must lock their coins up for at least the enactment delay period beyond the end of the referendum. There is also the possibility to vote without locking, but the vote’s value is drastically reduced.

Polkadot’s consensus system has a staking consensus protocol at the base. But besides becoming a validator with a 24/7 active node, the staking also engages a system of nominators.

The validators are there to validate transactions, and the nominators are there to nominate a validator.

The nominator can attribute his stake to up to 16 validators he trusts and will earn rewards based on their activities.

Polkadot has one of the highest annualized total reward rates, around 14%.

Thus, if you stake $1,000 in DOT, you can earn up to $140 a year, making it the best coin to stake from our list.

Polygon (MATIC)

Polygon is a platform designed to allow blockchain networks to connect and scale. It was launched in 2017 and operates on the Ethereum blockchain, connecting other Ethereum-based projects. Unlike other Proof-of-Stake projects, Polygon uses a modified PoS mechanism which allows a consensus to be achieved with every block. Validators who successfully complete a network transaction are rewarded with MATIC, Polygon’s native token.

MATIC is an ERC-20 token used to secure and govern the Polygon network, as well as paying transaction fees.

Currently, the yearly staking return for Polygon stands at around 7%, which means that if you stake $1,000 worth of MATIC, you will get a yearly reward of approximately $70. How to Start Staking Cryptocurrency

Open up a Node

Opening up a node can be a double-edged sword. It can be profitable, or it can be a massive waste of time with money locked up.

In most cases, it requires you to set up a dedicated application and lock up some cryptocurrency. However, if you want to set up a node for one of the proof-of-stake coins, consider the structure of their incentivizing layer.

If nodes are based solely on the stake’s size, your chances of actually getting to create a block are very low. So, a coin age mechanism that prevents the same users from creating blocks consecutively will improve your chances.

Additionally, in systems where you have to be elected and delegated by other users, branding and marketing your node to build credibility will be essential.

Third Parties such as Wallets and Exchanges

Setting up a node can involve a lot more effort than you would think, and there may even be a money barrier even in the case of the best coins to stake. Even for Ethereum 2.0, it was announced that you could start staking for Ether on a regular laptop, but only if you can stake at least 32 ETH.

A more accessible alternative for staking cryptocurrencies is to enter staking pools. And if you do not trust pools, you can easily do it with more trusted third parties.

Some of these third parties are:

Wallets (like Crypto.com and Exodus);

(like Crypto.com and Exodus); Exchanges (Coinbase, KuCoin, or Binance);

(Where it is possible).

When it comes to delegating, you should be extra cautious. Try delegating only in non-custodial environments and research the third party you’re about to delegate to.

And, of course, avoid every offer that sounds too good to be true.

Key Takeaways

Staking is the process within the Proof of Stake algorithm that involves a node’s appointment to validate the next block.

If a validator does not do his job correctly, he will lose some or even all of his stake.

Some of the best coins to stake are Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), and Polygon (MATIC).

You can start staking cryptos by opening up a node on your own or depositing your stake in a third-party platform like certain wallets or exchanges.

2022-10-31 11:48:04.761908,Business Post Nigeria,"Sustainable Finance Will Attract Growth, Development—SEC","By Aduragbemi Omiyale

As a country with abundant natural and human resources, Nigeria has been identified as better positioned to embrace sustainable finance principles and attract investment for the continent’s much-needed growth and development.

This was stated by the Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Mr Lamido Yuguda, during a lecture to mark the commemoration of the IOSCO World Investor Week with the theme Investor Resilience and Sustainable Finance, held Friday in Abuja.

The IOSCO World Investor Week is an annual event coordinated by IOSCO, which encourages its members, and securities regulators around the world to commemorate their respective jurisdictions to promote investor education and protection.

Mr Yuguda, represented by the SEC’s Executive Commissioner Operations, Mr Dayo Obisan, stated that the theme for this year’s WIW, ‘Investor Resilience’ and ‘Sustainable Finance’, demonstrates the high-value IOSCO places on investor protection and the environment, especially in the context of the global pandemic and other challenges such as inflationary pressures, uncertainties occasioned by geopolitical tensions, and continued environmental degradation.

According to him, “Indeed, the themes, undoubtedly, further place emphasis on the universal call for sustainable finance and its resultant economic growth and development. There is no doubt, therefore, that all jurisdictions must think of transiting from exploiting nature to restoring nature.

“It is worthy of note that SEC through the market development department, has done well to outline robust activities for the week-long global events.”

The SEC boss said sustainable finance has evolved as a global concept, and the world firmly stands together to promote the transition to a low-carbon, more resource-efficient economy towards building a financial system that incentivises sustainable growth across nations.

“World over, issuers and investors are embracing the idea of sustainable investing and environment-friendly projects, hence the significant surge in sustainable investment within the last few years, which is apparently driven mainly by investors’ desire for a cleaner, healthier and more equitable future.

“The commission, as a regulator, is very much aware of its critical role in ensuring that the financial sector is steered towards green investments through its policies and regulations.

The DG said it is in early recognition of the importance of sustainable finance, the commission came up with Rules on Green Bonds in 2018, and already three approvals were granted to some corporate Issuers. The organisation also issued Rules on Social Bonds in 2021.

In his remarks, Director Market Development Department, Mr Nestor Ikeagu, said the IOSCO WIW is an annual global week-long event aiming to promote investor education and protection and strengthen collaborations among member jurisdictions.

To commemorate the IOSCO WIW 2022, the Commission embarked on activities, such as enlightenment outreaches, social media campaigns and radio appearances, to mention a few.

Topics covered during the week presented participants with opportunities to discuss and reflect on what boosts and enhances investor resilience in the market, as well as sustainable finance as it involves making investment decisions that consider not only financial returns but also environmental, social, and governance factors.

2022-10-31 08:48:04.776209,Business Post Nigeria,Naira Redesigning Good for Economy—Buhari,"By Aduragbemi Omiyale

President Muhammadu Buhari has thrown his full weight behind the decision of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to redesign the higher Naira notes.

Last Wednesday, the Governor of the central bank, Mr Godwin Emefiele, announced plans to change the look of the N200, N500, and N1000 banknotes from December 15, 2022.

While addressing reporters at a special press briefing in Abuja, he disclosed that the old notes would seize to become legal tender in Nigeria from January 31, 2023, urging those with the Naira notes to approach their banks to exchange them for the new ones at no cost.

Two days after this announcement, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, while speaking with the Senate Committee on Finance in Abuja, opposed the Naira redesigning, saying she was not consulted about the issue, noting that she also heard it from the media like every other person, despite being a top member of the fiscal policy team of this government.

On Sunday, in an interview to be aired on Wednesday on Tambari TV on Nilesat, Mr Buhari said he authorised the apex bank to redesign the banknotes because he was convinced that the nation would gain a lot by doing so.

In a statement issued yesterday by Mr Garba Shehu, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Buhari said the economy stands to benefit from a reduction in inflation, currency counterfeiting and the excess cash in circulation just because of the action, which has generated controversies since its announcement.

According to the statement, the President did not consider three months for the change to the new notes as being short, saying, “People with illicit money buried under the soil will have a challenge with this but workers, businesses with legitimate incomes will face no difficulties at all.”

In the Hausa radio interview with the famous journalist Halilu Ahmed Getso and Kamaluddeen Sani Shawai, President Buhari also addressed food security and national security, among others.

2022-10-31 09:48:04.780158,RecentlyHeard,Terra Classic (LUNC) Gets A New Shooter Game On Unity Play,"The Dogecoin (DOGE) price has had an incredible weekend. Following Elon Musk’s confirmed Twitter acquisition, the DOGE price jumped 95% over the last seven days. The memecoin exploded to over $0.14 at times and is currently sitting at about $0.11.

Musk’s gigantic influence on the DOGE price is an old acquaintance for the crypto market. Over the past few years, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO kept moving the price with his statements. But since the Twitter acquisition, he has gone quiet. Musk has not mentioned Dogecoin since the deal was closed.

However DOGE fans remember April when Musk floated the idea of letting Twitter users pay with Dogecoin for his premium subscription service, Twitter Blue. Currently, rumors are circulating that Musk plans to have all users pay $20 for a blue check mark.

Some Tesla products can already be purchased on the automaker’s website using Dogecoin. The Boring Company accepts the cryptocurrency as payment for using the Las Vegas Loop.

Not everyone believes that Musk has good intentions. In June, a $258 billion lawsuit was filed against Musk, SpaceX and Tesla for manipulating the DOGE price. In September, the lawsuit was expanded to include seven new investors and six new defendants, including his tunneling company, Boring Co.

According to the lawsuit, Musk and the other defendants intentionally drove up the price of Dogecoin by more than 36,000% over two years and then caused it to crash. In doing so, the defendants “made tens of billions of dollars at the expense of other investors,” according to the complaint.

Are Dogecoin Whales Manipulating The Price?

But it’s not just Elon Musk, other whales seem to be setting the tone for the Dogecoin price as well. As new on-chain data shows, there were three whale alerts yesterday. The largest whale transferred 450 million DOGE, while the seventh largest whale received 10 million DOGE. In total, 402 million flowed out of Binance.

The price of DOGE surpassed $0.10 for the first time since May 2022 on Saturday, with a 24-hour gain of nearly 30%. An anonymous on-chain analyst posted the table below, which shows the latest 30-day holdings change of the top 10 holders of DOGE.

According to the analysis, it can be seen that two addresses are highly correlated with the price of DOGE. One of them is the largest whale, the exchange Robinhood, which transferred a total of 1.05B DOGE ($107.4M) on October 05, October 28 and October 29. Not elaborating what this means, it can be assumed that Robinhood is gathering a lot of retail interest for DOGE.

Further, the analyst notes that coincidentally, the address “DPDLBA” transferred 1.35B DOGE in early August. After the transfer, the price of DOGE exceeded $0.85 and reached its highest level after May.

The top-7 holder of DOGE is the other address impacting the market. From October 6th, the address received 5M or 10M DOGE every day. He also received 10M DOGE on Saturday and “it doesn’t seem to stop”.

“The last time address ‘DMuFDC’ received DOGE started on July 26 and stopped on August 5, after which the price of $DOGE started to rise. Now that he is still receiving $DOGE, does it mean that the price of $DOGE will continue to rise?”, the analyst concluded.","The Dogecoin (DOGE) price has had an incredible weekend.

The past week for LTC has remained quite positive for the altcoin as it logged over a 9% gain in that timeframe.

The coin has continued to form higher highs on its chart, demonstrating that the bulls were in control of the price.

That caused the altcoin to break its consolidation and shatter above important resistance marks. The technical outlook for the coin was bullish at the time of writing.

The demand for Litecoin registered appreciation as demand for the coin also shot up. The coin has established strong support for itself at the $53 price mark.

Currently, LTC trades at a vital price mark as the coin has struggled to move past this price level for the past several weeks.

If the bulls fail to sustain the price at the current price, a fall through the $53 support line will bring the bears back on the chart.

At this price mark, LTC is trading at an 86% low compared to its all-time high that the coin secured in May 2021.

Litecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart

LTC was trading at $56 at the time of writing. After a solid consolidation, the coin has finally been able to revisit the $56 price mark.

If Litecoin has to remain bullish, it has to continue trading above its current price zone. The coin will encounter immediate resistance at $57.

A move above $57 will help LTC to touch the $60 price mark. On the other hand, a slight loss in bullish strength, can drive the altcoin’s price down to $53 and then to $50.

The amount of Litecoin traded in the past session was in the green. This means that the buyers were back on the chart.

Technical Analysis

The altcoin has implied that the bulls were back as the demand for the altcoin noted an uptick on the one-day chart.

The Relative Strength Index was at the 60-mark, a sign of bullishness as buyers were more in number than sellers.

Litecoin price was above the 20-SMA line, which meant increased demand for the coin and also showed that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market.

The other technical indicators have also inclined towards the idea that bullishness has caused buying strength to increase on the one-day chart.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence displays the price momentum and the direction of the asset.

The MACD was bullish with green histograms above the half-line, which was the buy signal for the asset. Bollinger Bands indicate the price fluctuations and volatility of the coin.

2022-10-30 12:48:04.792654,RecentlyHeard,Ethereum Scores Over 22% Gains While Solana Recorded 15%,"AMD, Seagate, and EY form alliance to accelerate the adoption of decentralized storage by enterprises

SAN FRANCISCO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Protocol Labs and Filecoin Foundation together with other founding members, today announced the launching of the Decentralized Storage Alliance (the “Alliance”). The Alliance is a first-of-its-kind, member-led industry organization to drive awareness and adoption of decentralized technologies, such as Filecoin, IPFS, and libp2p, and help enterprises in Web2 make the transition to Web3 through education, advocacy, and best practices.

By 2025, the global data market is expected to exceed 200 zettabytes. Enterprise organizations account for 80% of total market demand, and over 90% of them rely on public clouds and other forms of centralized storage to store data, which is costly and not always efficient. Centralized players continue to consolidate the market, limiting pricing and data efficiency. According to a recent IDC survey titled “Why Decentralized Storage Based on Web3 Technology Will Ultimately Replace Many Public Cloud-Based Storage Services,” almost 86% of organizations had a positive view of decentralized storage.*

Decentralized storage networks enable more efficient, robust, secure storage – at a significantly lower cost than traditional data storage – while also giving more businesses the opportunity to participate in the data economy.

“With top-tier leaders across Web2 and Web3 coming together to explore the unrealized potential of decentralized technology, this Alliance has the power to transform the foundation of the internet,” said Stefaan Vervaet, Head of Network Growth, Protocol Labs. “Decentralized storage can provide assurances of data integrity, avoid data lock-in, meet data sovereignty requirements, and offers many significant advantages over traditional Web2 data solutions.”

The Alliance aims to bring together diverse viewpoints from leading Web2 and Web3 players.
