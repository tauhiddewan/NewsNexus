El Salvador has signed an MoU with Lugano to boost adoption

A “Bitcoin office” has been established in Lugano

Under “Plan B,” users will be able to utilize Bitcoin, , and LVGA tokens as legal tender.

Switzerland’s Lugano city reportedly signed an economic cooperation pact with El Salvador on October 28 during the city’s Plan B event powered by stablecoin issuer Tether. According to Lugano Mayor Michele Foletti, El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as a legal tender sparked Lugano’s interest in the arrangement, which will allow the pro-crypto country to create a physical government presence to “foster cooperation with educational and research institutions.”

El Salvador’s U.S. Ambassador Milena Mayorga said at Friday’s Plan B Forum in Lugano that her country will be building a “bitcoin office” and appointing an Honorary Consul to promote awareness of bitcoin throughout Lugano, Italy, and Europe.

Later, Mayorga was joined on stage by Mexican politician Indira Kempis, Serbia’s Prince Filip Karaorevi, Lugano’s Director of Economic Promotion Pietro Poretti, and, through video link, former congressperson and probable presidential contender Zury Rios from Guatemala. Rios did not make any concrete policy promises, but she did express her support for the idea that her country would embrace bitcoin.

Under the city’s “Plan B” initiative, people will be able to use Bitcoin, Tether, and LVGA tokens as “de facto” legal tender at a variety of local businesses and institutions, as well as for the payment of taxes, parking fines, public services, and school tuition.

According to El Salvador’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Joaquin Alexander Maza Martelli, “the use of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology creates new opportunities for growth and investment that benefit our communities; it is a new alternative financial and exchange tool that fosters trade and the provision of services in a globalized world.”

Last year, El Salvador became the first country in the world to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender. Businesses in the nation are required by law to accept the asset as payment if they have the technical capability to do so.

Meanwhile, Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, has invested millions of dollars in Bitcoin, and Bitcoin aficionados have rushed to the country to attend conferences and promote the currency’s adoption.

2022-10-31 09:40:18.224719,CryptoMode,Big Eyes Is On An Unstoppable Rise: Can The Cat Coin Surpass Top 5 Cryptocurrencies Like Tether And Binance? – CryptoMode,"Tether (USDT) and Binance (BNB) are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies around. But with the crypto industry constantly changing, there is no guarantee that these coins will maintain their position in the foreseeable future.

This is especially because quirkier, stranger, and ultimately more lucrative cryptos like Big Eyes Coin (BIG) are being introduced.

Cryptocurrency will always be about making a healthy return from your investment. A digital, business proposition where staking your hold in the right coin can be life-changing.

However, in an industry so volatile, the need for additional perks with each investment is becoming increasingly important. It’s simply not enough anymore to check coinmarket every day and pray for a positive spike in value.

Further incentives are required to keep crypto geeks hooked and happy to remain in the crypto ecosystem. Meme coins hit the nail on the head by adding an element of fun with games, NFTs, and an interactive community.

This doesn’t mean the likes of Tether and Binance lose their utility, rather in the grand scheme of things, enjoyable and transcending cryptocurrencies like Big Eyes Coin are likely to entice a greater variety of investors apart from the average crypto nerd.

There Is No Hell For Leather With Tether

As a stablecoin, Tether is never going to set the crypto world alight, but that’s exactly the point. Since its inception in 2014, Tether has always maintained a price of around $1, hence being very ‘stable’.

Tether is the ideal cryptocurrency if you want to broaden your financial portfolio, enter the crypto market for the first time with minimal risks or purchase certain products and services that accept it as payment.

However, unlike Binance or Big Eyes Coin, the potential to make a profit is little to none. So for investors who are only interested in financial gain, Tether doesn’t make much sense.

Binance Does The Basics

Binance Coin is a lot more rounded than Tether. At the time of writing, Binance is priced at $288.32 and peaked at $650.47 back in November 2021. Therefore, there is immense potential to make a profit for savvy investors.

Furthermore, Binance Coin has its own platform. A website where investors can settle transaction fees, take part in exclusive token sales, and pay for a large array of goods and services.

But apart from that, there is nothing overly exciting about Binance. It’s just one cryptocurrency out of many with profit-making potential.

Big Eyes Coin Is Booming

Big Eyes Coin has raised over $9 million in its presale and with several stages to go, the cat currency is only going to generate more funds before its official release.

Not your average crypto, Big Eyes is looking to stand out from an ocean of meme coins by proposing top ten adorable NFTs, an interactive cat-loving community, and charity donations.

Speaking of oceans, Big Eyes Coin intends to donate 5% of its total supply to ocean-saving charities, meaning less global warming, a cleaner environment, and an increased supply of tastier fish for the non-digital cats of the world.

So while investing in an inevitably lucrative coin, investors will simultaneously do their bit to help the planet. Besides, becoming addicted to a range of cute and colourful items in the NFT Sushi Crew.

Still, crypto nerds must act fast if they want to get a headstart on Big Eyes Coin and they can, by using the code BEYES970 for a bonus.

USDT/USD -0.04% Add to/Remove from Watchlist ETH/USD +1.48% Add to/Remove from Watchlist USDC/USD -0.01% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Huobi has delisted its HUSD stablecoin.

The price of HUSD is down more than 70% from the $1 mark.

Huobi hasn’t provided a reason behind the delisting.

HUSD, the fiat-collateralized stablecoin from Huobi dropped below the dollar mark. At press time, HUSD is priced at $0.29, down more than 60% over the past 24 hours. The drop accelerated after news broke that Huobi was planning on delisting the token. According to the exchange’s official release, the delisting is part of the exchange’s “continuous efforts to promote the healthy development of the blockchain ecosystem.”

HUSD is an ERC-20 stablecoin backed 1:1 by U.S. dollars kept in bank accounts controlled by Paxos in the United States. It was created to combine four stablecoins into a single asset that could be traded on Huobi: Paxos Standard, True USD, , and Gemini Dollars.

HUSD previously de-pegged earlier this year, hitting a low of $0.82 per HUSD on August 18. HUSD fell below the $1 parity on October 11 and again on October 28. In August, when the stablecoin fell below the $1 peg, Huobi tweeted about the issue, stating:

We are aware of the current liquidity issues associated with the HUSD stablecoin, which is issued by Stable Universal Limited and built on the network

More importantly, HUSD’s official Twitter account also announced the shutting down of multiple market maker accounts on the same day. The stablecoin issuer tweeted:

“Recently, we had made the decision to close several accounts in specific regions to comply with legal requirements, which included some market maker accounts. Due to the time difference in banking hours, this resulted in a short-term liquidity problem but has since been resolved.”

The stablecoin was removed from Huobi’s exchange on October 28. Exchange users who had HUSD had their balances automatically converted to , a stablecoin asset. Moreover, the entire conversion process to Tether is expected to be completed by November 4.

Prior to delisting HUSD, Huobi announced that it would be delisting many HUSD token trading pairs. Many expect this to be the move that triggered the de-pegging. As of now, there have been no comments from Huobi as to why it de-listed the stablecoin.

2022-10-31 03:40:18.249911,DualShockers,Apex Legends: 10 Pro Tips For Playing Ash,"Ash flaunts an impressive and aggressive playstyle, and here are some tips and tricks you can use to play the Legend more effectively in Apex Legends.

There are currently 21 astonishing legends to choose from in Apex Legends. With so many options, it can feel like a daunting task to learn them all and figure out which one suits you best.

RELATED: Apex Legends: Best Tips And Tricks For Playing Revenant

For those who love highly aggressive plays and an extremely versatile tool kit, ash is a great pick. However, there is a lot more to her than what originally meets the eye! Luckily, this guide will go in-depth on some dandy tips and tricks to really master Ash in Apex Legends.

DUALSHOCKERS VIDEO OF THE DAY

10/10 Newton's First Law

In Ash's case, an object in motion really does stay in motion. Ash's tactical ability will fly on indefinitely unless it comes into contact with either an object or an enemy. There are tons of ways to use this to your advantage.

Although it is slow flying, it works wonders at clearing out long hallways and other such environments. Simply send it down parallel to the ground, forcing enemies to flee or get caught. This also works vertically, making it viable for pushing enemies out of position above you.

9/10 Choke Points

While it is not its main purpose, Ash's tactical is phenomenal when it comes to preventing enemies from pushing choke points. Whether you are trying to hide in a building or keep an enemy trapped inside one, very few are willing to risk running directly through a tether trap.

Keep in mind that the tether will stick to a wall or a floor and last for quite a while until it eventually dissolves. This should give you just enough time to use a quick healing item, reload, or even loot.

8/10 Verticality

It is important to note that Ash's ultimate travels extremely far when used vertically. When you find yourself trapped on the low ground with an enemy shooting down on you, it is generally very easy to escape.

If you typically only use the ultimate horizontally, you are really missing out. Don't forget that one of Ash's primary focuses is getting the high ground on enemies. Don't underestimate the potential distance of her ultimate.

7/10 Be Prepared

While Ash is passive, marked for death, and provides vital information on where the enemy is, it can also get you killed. Many players fail to realize that enemies are alerted when they are scanned by Ash. In many circumstances, this effectively reveals to them where you are as well.

All this is to say, make sure your team is prepared to fight before you scan a death box because it is impossible to tell whether the team is across the map or right around the corner.

6/10 Birds Eye

It is often overlooked that Ash can see when death boxes appear all over the map, not just in her immediate vicinity. This is vital information when players are deciding where to rotate as the storm closes. Especially towards the middle of the match, when the fighting slows down in the final rings approach. Whether you want to third-party other fights or avoid enemies, don't forget to check the entire map.

5/10 One Way Trip

While this tip may be a little obvious to those who have played Ash before, many new players don't realize that ashes portal is a one-way trip! This means if you use Ash's ultimate directly into an enemy team, there is no way back.

RELATED: Apex Legends Tier List: Best Characters In Season Fourteen

It's important that players are aware of this because it could mean life or death. Be thorough and scout an area before teleporting. In other words, look before you leap!

4/10 You Are Loud!

Image courtesy Respawn Entertainment

While most legends' ultimate abilities have rather obvious sound cues, perhaps none are as loud as ashes. If you were trying to flank an enemy with her portal, just be aware that they are likely going to know you are coming.

Both the creation, entry, and exit of the portal are extremely loud. The sound is essentially a dead giveaway as to where you and your teammates are. For this reason, it is also important that all team members are aware before Ash uses her ultimate. You don't want an enemy team pushing the sound queue when teammates aren't ready. Ash is not and never was meant to be a stealthy character.

3/10 A Big Bubble

A fantastic perk of Ash's tactical is the sheer square footage that it occupies. A common misconception is that enemies must run directly into the trap for it to take effect, but that is simply not true. A large bubble surrounds the tether, and any enemy unlucky enough to touch it in any capacity will be stunned.

This is valuable info, as it will allow for more thought-out and effective plays with Ash's tactical. For instance, by throwing the ability in a corner with two adjacent doors, you can efficiently block off both entrances from enemy advancements.

2/10 Grenades Are Your Friend

No, really! As Ash, grenades are absolutely indispensable. Thermites and Arc-stars will allow for some of the easiest kills in the game! This is, of course, only true when they are combined with Ash's aforementioned tactical. Snag an opposing player and light them up with explosives! With no way to defend themselves, it is practically a guaranteed knock.

There is, however, a balance of how many grenades you should carry. Everybody has a different play style, but it is recommended to carry 2 grenades in a gray backpack and to add 2 to the mix for every additional level. Depending on how efficient you are with your tactical though, it may be wise to carry a couple more.

1/10 The Getaway

When it comes to making those quick escapes, Ash's kit rivals even the very best. This is due mostly to one incredible combo! The icing on the cake? It is unbelievably easy to pull off.

Most aggressive enemies will chase the Ash mains through their portals for a kill, but this can be easily countered with Ash's tactical ability. Before using the Phase Breach ability, simply throw a tether directly at your feet! (Don't worry, it won't snare you!) This will prevent any enemies from being able to follow you through the portal - at least for a few seconds. This will give you precious time to recoup and maybe even throw a few Thermites at the portal exit if they still decide to push!

2022-10-31 10:40:18.261339,Los Angeles Times,Op-Ed: Searching for ties to the Middle East in my mother’s old photos,"Among a stack of photos from my mother’s childhood is a black-and-white picture from when she was 7 or 8. She’s standing on the sunlit balcony of her family’s apartment in Cairo. Her face looks directly into the camera, half in shadow.

Revisiting old photographs has become like the rituals my mother tried to preserve at our home in Ohio — the way she’d prepare Turkish coffee when my maternal grandmother would visit; the lamb she’d cook at Christmas with slivers of almonds and raisins buried in the rice; her love of Egypt’s legendary singer Umm Kulthum, whose melodic and low voice my mother taught me was like a sadness.

It wasn’t sudden like a spark, but gradual with time, that I realized the full extent of what I’d lost when my mother died 12 years ago. In addition to her presence in my life, her voice, any fight we’d ever have again, what dissipated like dew was a tangible connection to the Middle East. For me, photos have bridged the loss.

My 95-year-old grandmother has created her own rituals of remembrance, collecting items in the spare bedroom in her apartment in Montreal into a shrine of her daughter’s things: Paintings, photographs and handwritten cards hang on the walls and spill over the end table.

“You can have anything you want in here,” she said, the last time I visited, as if removing one item would relieve some unseen pressure.

In many ways, we use rituals to tether us to a particular place or a community of people. I see now that my mother’s rituals were her small ways to hold on to what she and my dad left behind before immigrating to the U.S. It was also her way to tether my brother and me — American-born children — to where our family came from.

I am learning that rituals are not just old practices that are passed down through generations. They can be something new and created — like a habit or a process — to deal with loss and the heavy weight of grief.

Since my mother died, I have been curating an envelope of photographs from our family trips to Egypt. Here I am — at 6 and 12 and 17. You’ll catch our faces in front of the pyramids or standing by the Nile River in either Luxor or Aswan. There we are with extended family in their Cairene apartments, our bulky sweaters giving away the time of year. Here I am eating pigeon for the first time, an Egyptian delicacy, my mother would tell me, as I licked the grease from my fingers, trying not to look too closely at the shape of the small, delicate body on my plate.

These are mixed with black-and-white photos from when my mom was a kid — like the one on the balcony — many unmarked, devoid of location or date or time.

I piece together clues. My mother and her mother on top of cragged rocks in front of an unnamed sea, faces windswept and out of focus. My mother’s school headshot — this one with a date — she’s 15 and frozen as a gangly teen with a gap in her teeth she chose to never fix.

I inherited these boxes of family photographs after she died. Each time I tried to remove a cardboard lid and put order to the chaos of the images inside, I became instantly overwhelmed: “How,” I asked myself, “can I possibly do this without her?”

Over time, I turned the weight into a ritual. I periodically open a dented box, pull out one or two photos I remember or want to know more about and put them in a separate envelope. I tuck the envelope into my desk drawer and close the door until I have an urge to look at them.

I don’t know what I’m looking for in this bouquet of photographs. But the process of finding a long-lost photo brings me back to everything I miss that made the Middle East come alive in our every day: the sound of my mother’s Arabic and French, mixed in a messy sentence; the traditional meals she cooked — kofta, kousa, ful and taamiya, basboosa and baklava; the smells of her spice rack and her pantry, like another family member. All of it returns as two-dimensional images invoke whole scenes and trigger every sense.

My grandmother told me this year that she’d like my 8-year-old daughter to have her old photographs, as if this is another of her own rituals, the transfer of memories to the next generation.

I didn’t respond, worried about what it would mean for my daughter to carry the weight of unnamed faces, unmarked places and unknown dates with her in tattered boxes.

But perhaps it’s not for me to say.

Perhaps it’s up to my daughter to uncover her own ritual among these photos, and to weave together the pieces she hopes never to lose.

2022-10-31 04:40:18.614445,Pitchfork,Twain: Noon,"At the end of “Noon,” the first song on Twain’s new album of the same name, Matthew Davidson makes a promise to someone long departed: “I will not forget,” he sings over a simple piano theme and a volley of solemn cymbal crashes. It’s not the words that hit so hard, but the way he delivers them, in particular the way he delivers that last one. He holds that final note for way too long, sustaining that vowel until his voice quivers and feathers into the air. It sounds unplanned, a spontaneous decision, an act of intuition that gestures toward a bittersweet realization: Simply not forgetting will not be enough to keep that person in his life. That long note also reminds you that there’s a physical body singing the airy songs on Noon. For better or for worse, the music might just float away if he didn’t tether it.

A music industry equivalent of a character actor, Davidson is one of those veteran musicians whose work you’ve heard even if you missed out on Twain’s 2017 breakthrough, Rare Feeling, or any of his solo releases since. In the late 2000s he joined the Low Anthem and helped them expand their scope and palette; more recently, he has been playing fiddle with the Deslondes and working with Big Thief, even contributing to their recent double album Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You. Twain is his leading role, an opportunity to step toward the front of the stage. Especially for a multi-instrumentalist credited with guitar, keys, and pedal steel on such a wide variety of projects, there’s something startling about the restraint he shows on Noon. He keeps the arrangements light, sparse yet spry, and he jettisons the electric guitar and drums of Rare Feeling for a sound that mixes acoustic guitar with soft percussion and flourishes of piano and reeds.

Bitcoin's lack of volatility lately isn't a bad thing and could actually point to signs of a ""bottoming out"" in prices, analysts and investors told CNBC. Digital currencies have fallen sharply since a scorching run in 2021 which saw bitcoin climb as high as $68,990. But for the past few months, bitcoin's price has bounced stubbornly around $20,000 in a sign that volatility in the market has settled. Last week, the cryptocurrency's 20-day rolling volatility fell below that of the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes for the first time since 2020, according to data from crypto research firm Kaiko. Stocks and cryptocurrencies are both down sharply this year as interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve and a strengthening dollar weighed on the sector. Bitcoin's correlation with stocks has increased over time as more institutional investors have invested in crypto.

But bitcoin's price has stabilized recently. And for some investors, that easing of volatility is a good sign. ""Bitcoin has essentially been range bound between 18-25K for 4 months now, which indicates consolidation and a potential bottoming out pattern, given we are seeing the Dollar index top out as well,"" Vijay Ayyar, head of international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC in emailed comments."" ""In previous cases such as in 2015, we've seen BTC bottom when DXY has topped, so we could be seeing a very similar pattern play out here."" Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto lender Nexo, said bitcoin's price stability was ""a strong sign that the digital assets market has matured and is becoming less fragmented.""

An end to crypto winter?

Cryptocurrencies have suffered a brutal comedown this year, losing $2 trillion in value since the height of the 2021 rally. Bitcoin, the world's biggest digital coin, is off around 70% from its November peak. The current so-called ""crypto winter"" is largely the result of aggressive tightening from the Fed, which has been hiking interest rates in an effort to tame rocketing inflation. Large crypto investors with highly leveraged bets like Three Arrows Capital were floored by the pressure on prices, further accelerating the market's drop. However, some investors think the ice may now be beginning to thaw.

watch now

There are signs of an ""accumulation phase,"" according to Ayyar, when institutional investors are more willing to place bets on bitcoin given the lull in prices. ""Bitcoin being stuck in such a range does make it boring, but this is also when retail loses interest and smart money starts to accumulate,"" Ayyar said. Matteo Dante Perruccio, president of international at digital asset management firm Wave Financial, said he's seen a ""counterintuitive increase in demand of traditional institutional investors in crypto during what is a time where generally you would see interest fall off in the traditional markets."" Financial institutions have continued taking steps into crypto despite the fall in prices and waning interest from retail investors. Mastercard announced a service that allows banks to offer crypto trading, having previously launched a new blockchain security tool for card issuers. Visa, meanwhile, teamed up with crypto exchange FTX to offer debit cards linked to users' trading accounts. Goldman Sachs suggested we may be close to the end of a ""particularly bearish"" period in the latest cycle of crypto movements. In a note released Thursday, analysts at the bank said there were parallels with bitcoin's trading in Nov. 2018, when prices steadied for a while before rising steadily.

""Low volatility [in Nov. 2018] was following a large bitcoin bear market,"" Goldman's analysts wrote, adding that ""crypto QT"" (quantitative tightening) occurred as investors poured out of stablecoins like tether, reducing liquidity. The circulating supply of USD Coin — a stablecoin that's pegged to the U.S. dollar — has fallen $12 billion since June, while tether's circulating supply has dropped over $14 billion since May. Selling pressure has slowed, too, as bitcoin miners reduced their sales of the cryptocurrency, suggesting the worst may be over for the mining space. Publicly-traded bitcoin miners sold 12,000 bitcoins in June and only around 3,000 in September, according to Goldman Sachs. Wave Financial's Perruccio expects the second quarter of next year to be the time when crypto winter finally comes to an end. ""We'll have seen a lot more failures in the DeFi [decentralized finance] space, a lot of the smaller players, which is absolutely necessary for the industry to evolve,"" he added.

SHIB saw a growing number of daily active addresses.

The meme coin is currently trading at $0.00001351 after a 13.55% increase in price.

According to new data provided by Santiment, it is possible for Shiba Inu (SHIB) to follow in the footsteps of (DOGE) after the meme coin had a very successful week following Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter.

Dogecoin & Shiba Inu price vs. BTC volume Source: Santiment

According to Santiment, SHIB historically followed DOGE’s pumps. This theory could be proven by the fact that SHIB saw a 19% increase in price over the last seven days following DOGE’s surge. In addition to this, both DOGE and SHIB saw increases in volume over the past few days.

Another sign that SHIB could be seeing some growth is the meme coin’s growing number of daily active addresses. Adding to this is the fact that SHIB saw an increase in velocity over the last week. Thai increase in velocity suggests that the frequency at which addresses are moving between addresses are growing.

Another indication of possible SHIB growth is the fact that the crypto’s network experienced an uptick in the number of new addresses that transferred SHIB for the very first time. This could imply that there is some renewed interest in the meme coin.

Recent data from WhaleStats are also counting in SHIB’s favor. According to the whale tracking website, SHIB was one of the most traded tokens by the top 2000 ETH whales on October 28. In addition to this, the top 5000 ETH whales hold about $94 million worth of SHIB at the moment.

According to CoinMarketCap, SHIB is currently trading at $0.00001351 after a 13.55% increase in price over just 24 hours. In addition to this, the meme coin is also in the green by over 35% over the last week.

2022-10-31 12:40:18.641499,InsideBitcoins,Myanmar’s crypto battles,"Join Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage

Myanmar’s economy has been crippled since the February 1, 2021 coup. The World Bank predicted that it would contract by 18% per year. As a result, the Myanmar kyat has lost 60% of its value as of September 2021. This is an all-time low: on September 17, 2021, the black market value of Myanmar kyats (MMK) to US dollars (USD) was 2200, down from 1330 before the coup. These facts demonstrate the public’s mistrust of the military-led State Administration Council (SAC).

People’s reliance on banking systems and the entire financial mechanism has been reduced. It pushes Myanmarese people to use cryptocurrencies as an alternative currency. Both the SAC and the shadow National Unity Government (NUG) acknowledged this requirement with their respective mandates: the former to use digital currency to heal the crippled economy and avoid sanctions, and the latter to separate the existing currency from the state and establish an alternative independent currency to ensure free and secure funding streams. Both parties have also announced cryptocurrency initiatives; it will be interesting to see who emerges victorious in this battle of crypto dreams.

The crypto dream of the revolutionaries

Last year, an anonymous developer group created MYD, a digital currency that aims to free people from the junta’s centralized currency. The cryptocurrency intended to fund the NUG with 45 percent of its currency and distribute the remaining 55 percent to citizens. MYD, on the other hand, ceased operations in December 2021 due to a failure to build a scalable user base and accessibility issues. Following that, the NUG announced that Tether (USDT), a stable cryptocurrency with a dollar peg, would officially replace the Myanmar kyat. U Tin Tun Naing, the NUG’s minister of planning, finance, and investment, stated, “When the time comes and if it is required for our revolution, we will definitely expand the list of our approved cryptocurrencies.” The anti-junta group’s desire to empower cryptocurrency is significant, as evidenced by these initiatives.

However, NUG’s cryptocurrency selection has some questionable aspects. The NUG government chose Tether to prevent transaction tracing, to create better and faster transactions, and to achieve financial stability. Tether is the third largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of USD 76 billion, and it, like Bitcoin, can be transferred in transactions that are difficult for governments to track.

However, in terms of financial stability, US Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren warned in June 2021 that Tether could pose a risk to financial stability. Bernhard Muller, a crypto trader, DeFi (Decentralized Finance) auditor, and security analyst, also wrote that Tether could become a cryptocurrency black swan, with its stability collapsing dramatically. It is unclear whether the shadow government’s crypto dream will be reliant on Tether.

The dictator’s crypto fantasy

Long before the coup, all forms of cryptocurrency were outlawed in Myanmar. The Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) declared a cryptocurrency ban in 2020, referring to Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Perfect Money (PM), and all traders would face monetary penalties. Again, in response to the NUG government’s declaration of Tether as official currency in December 2021, the SAC drafted a cybersecurity law that criminalized the use of VPNs and cryptocurrency in January 2022. The military’s move is ironic in that, shortly after the ban on cryptocurrency, in February 2022, they announced that they are developing a digital currency.

Maj General Zaw Min Tun, the military’s SAC spokesperson, stated, “A digital currency will help improve financial activities in Myanmar.” The SAC is attempting to resurrect the badly damaged economy through the use of digital currency. Central banks from around the world are pursuing the dream of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), such as China’s Digital Yuan project, in order to boost economies hit by the pandemic. Nonetheless, at a conference, Kim Edwards, the World Bank’s senior economist for Myanmar, stated, “We think the country is not in the best position to pursue something like this.”

The military, on the other hand, has been surveilling and arresting anti-junta groups by tracking phone numbers from Wave Money, K Pay, CB Pay, and other services. Another possibility for the junta’s goal of a digital currency is the dream of centralized manipulation of people’s transaction data in one place so that they can monitor and control citizens more seamlessly.

The role of cryptocurrency in resistance and repression

The grand discourse of the cryptocurrency movement itself leads to the decoupling of currency and state. It is clear that, since Satoshi’s whitepaper, the narrative surrounding cryptocurrency has been all about resisting state power. Venezuela’s cryptocurrency revolution has been portrayed as a model of both resistance and repression.

Venezuela is one of the world’s fastest adopters of cryptocurrency. Since 2013, the bolivar has lost over 2000% of its value against the US dollar, resulting in the world’s most extreme hyperinflation. Sanctions imposed by the US and a skyrocketing unemployment rate are adding fuel to the hyperinflation fire. To get out of the situation, Venezuelans turned to cryptocurrencies, which they can freely use anywhere in the world without government regulation. One of the best examples of resistance would be Valiu, a blockchain-based remittance platform. Venezuelans in the diaspora can send money to their families in Venezuela, buy food and other necessities with Valiu, and invest in cryptocurrencies with pesos. However, due to the risks of Venezuela’s situation, the great initiative announced its closure in December 2021.

On the repression front, the Venezuelan government is attempting to centralize the crypto movement through the creation of Petro, a national digital currency. Venezuela is just one of many countries interested in using cryptocurrencies or blockchain-based digital currencies for centralization and surveillance. For example, China has been urging the creation of a national digital currency, Digital Yuan, which the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has referred to as a “sovereign currency” since 2014.

According to the Washington Post, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) wants to increase surveillance of its people by establishing a more centralized digital currency. The Digital Yuan only allows for “controlled anonymity,” which means that the state will define and control citizens’ personally identifiable information to a large extent. The currency will function as one of the toolkits of China’s “Social Credit System,” which is one of the world’s most intrusive digital public administration tools.

In conclusion

Venezuela’s crypto revolution currently shares political and economic contexts with Myanmar. However, in Myanmar, both sides’ strategies for crypto dreams focus on legislative activities rather than the development of the crypto economy. In the case of Venezuela, rather than legislation, the development of the crypto economy was driven by social digital innovations, a deep understanding of value creation and distribution, and the ability to reach out to grassroots communities. Myanmar’s crypto revolution is just getting started in its tug of war between repression and resistance. It will be crucial in Myanmar’s political revolution, determining whether the country will be able to restore democracy or sink into authoritarianism.

2022-10-31 09:40:18.674778,Bloomberg Law,,"By the time he arrived in London in January, Kyle Roche was on a roll.

Weeks earlier, his firm had scored a $100 million judgment against a self-proclaimed Bitcoin inventor, another step to break from the pack of attorneys trying to make their mark in cryptocurrency law.

Roche had also landed as a client the blockchain startup Ava Labs, paying him and his partners in digitized tokens worth millions.

Now, barely five years out of law school, the young lawyer had come to woo potential investors for a startup venture he said he was working on with Ava Labs. In one restaurant meeting, with the alcohol flowing, the lawyer touted himself as a “crazy motherf—er” when it came to court battles. He also boasted about a bold litigation strategy on behalf of Ava Labs—using investor class-action suits to weigh down their competitors.

In another private gathering that day, he crowed: “Because I sue half the companies in this space, I know where this market is going.”

What he didn’t know: His comments were being recorded.

Those conversations, including one in which Roche boasted his job included giving US regulators other “magnets” to go after, became the fuse that ignited a spectacularly swift downfall for an apparent fast-rising star in the niche field. Since videos of them were anonymously posted online in August, Roche has lost his role as a lead attorney in potentially law-defining cases, exited the firm he founded and retreated from public view.

How it happened offers a window into what can be the cutthroat nature of a fledgling trillion-dollar industry, one whose volatility has engendered a flood of lawsuits, courtroom skirmishes, and, in this case, an apparent elaborate scheme to take down a lawyer.

It’s still unclear who was behind the secret recordings or behind Crypto Leaks, the website that posted them. Roche and his former firm, in statements online and in court, have denied wrongdoing and claimed the videos were selectively edited to erase important context.

They have asserted the hidden-camera ambush was orchestrated by representatives for a Swiss blockchain firm they had sued just months before the London meetings, though they’ve not offered evidence to substantiate it.

Roche declined to comment to Bloomberg Law. But much of the story has emerged through legal proceedings, court filings, public statements and interviews, including with the prominent Norwegian investor at the center of it all.



The Crypto Lawyer

Roche’s interest in crypto took off during his first year at the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law in 2013, when he became fascinated by the legal systems surrounding currency. As a student, he collaborated with one professor on a paper touting the long-term advantages of the decentralized digital asset Bitcoin.

After graduating in 2016, he landed at the Armonk, N.Y., office of Boies Schiller Flexner, the vaunted Big Law firm, and began representing clients in crypto-related disputes.

Roche speaking at an event in 2017.

Three years later, he co-founded his own firm, one eventually filled with ex-Boies lawyers specializing in fast-developing areas like crypto. One early client, Ava Labs, even agreed to pay them with its fledgling AVAX digital tokens, which had not yet entered the market. Roche also got an equity stake in the company.

Roche and his co-founder, Devin “Velvel” Freedman, had for months worked on novel legal theories they’d argue under their new banner. Their first suit, filed in October 2019, accused the crypto exchange Bitfinex and its affiliate Tether, the company behind the Tether stablecoin, of a multibillion-dollar price manipulation scheme.

The firm later teamed with New York boutique Selendy Gay Elsberg to file 11 suits against crypto exchanges and token issuers for the alleged sale of unregistered securities.

Meanwhile, their Ava Labs bet paid massive dividends. After being introduced in 2020, the value of AVAX tokens owned collectively by Roche Freedman lawyers once reached $250 million, according to claims one partner later made in federal court.

Roche and Freedman also found the spotlight representing a client suing Craig Wright, who has claimed to be the person who developed Bitcoin. The estate of Wright’s alleged former business partner claimed it was entitled to half a cache of Bitcoin they mined together in the asset’s early years.

A federal jury in Florida cleared Wright in December 2021 of claims including fraud and theft, but ordered him to pay a $100 million judgment for the unlawful seizure of intellectual property.

Roche Freedman touted the judgment as precedent-setting. Roche would later cite the verdict to support his litigation bona fides.

“The litigation with Craig Wright put them on the map,” said Stephen D. Palley, a lawyer who has written on legal topics relating to crypto.

Weeks after that case, however, Roche took the trip that would change his fortunes.

Looking for Partners

He arrived in London hoping to line up investors for a litigation crowdfunding startup he wanted to develop with Ava Labs. Named Ryval, the venture was intended to allow people to place bets on litigation on Ava’s Avalanche platform.

On a Thursday afternoon, Roche traveled to a three-story townhouse in the city’s upscale Mayfair section that served as the office of Christen Ager-Hanssen, a high-profile venture capitalist who has reportedly made and lost millions in tech and media deals. Ager-Hanssen covered the first-class airfare and hotel costs for Roche and his fiancee, Roche would later say in a declaration submitted in court.

The meeting was arranged by an independent business consultant living in London, Ager-Hanssen said in an interview and a written statement to Bloomberg Law. The Norwegian businessman said he had never before met the consultant, who identified himself as Mauricio Andres Villavicencio de Aguilar. According to emails shared with Bloomberg Law, the consultant had first contacted Ager-Hanssen in November 2021 about coordinating a potential investment opportunity in the blockchain arena.

Ager-Hanssen said he quizzed Roche at his office for a couple hours about Ava Labs and the proposed startup. He said he did not record the meeting, or know who did, but that the video excerpts later released were from the consultant’s vantage at the table. He also said he did not go with Roche to the restaurant that night, but that the consultant did.

Christen Ager-Hanssen

Ager-Hanssen said he was intrigued by the Ryval concept, and flew to New York weeks later to continue talking with Roche and Ava Labs executives. By March, however, his interest had waned and he opted not to invest.

The startup plans lagged in the ensuing months. Roche still stayed busy, splitting his time between New York and Miami as his firm grew to more than 20 lawyers and became more active in the class-action sphere when the digital asset market plummeted.

The crash stoked a lot of scrutiny. Amid the fallout, an anonymous website emerged, promising to root out bad actors.

‘Evil Conspiracy’

Crypto Leaks announced itself in June with a website, a Twitter account, and pledges to expose corruption in the fledgling industry.

“Follow us to find out what vested interests don’t want you to know,” it said in its inaugural tweet. But Crypto Leaks hid behind its own curtain: Its domain was anonymously registered that May.

Its first two posts focused on what it called “attacks” on the Internet Computer blockchain and the once-buzzy ICP token introduced by the Dfinity Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit led by Dominic Wiliams. The digital asset quickly plummeted in value after being sold to retail investors in May 2021.

Neither of the website’s first posts got traction. Then, on Aug. 26, Crypto Leaks released its third so-called “case study.”

“Ava Labs (Avalanche) attacks Solana and cons SEC in evil conspiracy with bought law firm, Roche Freedman” blared the headline.

The post claimed to reveal “an extraordinary secret pact” between Roche Freedman and Ava Labs “that harms the crypto industry.” It described Roche as a lawyer who used the legal system “gangster style” to attack Ava Labs’ competitors, and pursue “personal vendettas” for the blockchain company’s leader.

Weaved into the text were 25 video clips of Roche speaking in two settings: at the conference table in the Mayfair office that January afternoon and in the bustling restaurant he visited later that night, in front of a plate of food and a wine goblet.

Excerpts from both showed Roche explaining his close ties to Ava Labs and his win-or-go-home approach to litigation, and at times disparaging the legal system. In one clip, he reveled in “the fact that 10 idiots control the flow of all the money that happens in American class actions.”

The Fallout

The recordings’ release sparked a quick disavowal from Ava Labs’ CEO and statements from leaders across the crypto space—both about what Roche said and whoever recorded it.

“Who’s funding all these hit pieces?” tweeted Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges.

Roche quickly denied deploying litigation as a weapon to go after Ava Labs’ competitors and vowed to fight efforts to intimidate him and his firm. But the blowback was intense. In court filings, his firm said he had received “threats of violence” in the days after the recordings were released.

Roche

Within days, Roche’s partners announced he was barred from participating in any ongoing class action. They called the move an attempt to protect the firm against appearances of impropriety.

That didn’t stifle Roche’s detractors. Lawyers for Bitfinex and Tether, defendants in a class-action suit brought by Roche Freedman, called for the entire firm to be disqualified, claiming the videos raised “grave concerns” about their motivations.

At least four defendants in other cases, including Dfinity, also brought disqualification motions against the law firm, citing Roche’s London comments as a conflict of interest.

At least one of Roche’s clients dropped him. One partner left the firm.

Ava Labs also sought to distance itself. CEO Emin Gun Sirer called the allegations of targeting competitors through litigation “conspiracy theory nonsense” and said Roche made false statements about his work for the company. By mid-September, he publicly declared that Roche no longer represented Ava Labs and that he’d relinquished his shares in the company.

The next month, Roche’s partners fought to keep the firm’s role as lead counsel in the class action against Bitfinex and Tether—a case they had been litigating for three years. They argued they were victims of a scheme by another defendant in a separate case to cripple the firm’s cryptocurrency practice.

New York Judge Katherine Polk Failla was unpersuaded, concluding that Roche’s “uniquely stupid” comments were “too detailed to dismiss” as just being “drunk and stupid.” She said she recognizes the difference between Roche and his partners, but said, “at this point in time, I have concerns about the firm as well.”

Roche, meanwhile, tried to identify his saboteur.

He publicly claimed that Ager-Hanssen had been working for Williams, the Dfinity leader. He offered no evidence to back up the claim, but in a post on the website Medium, Roche cited a 2017 article in The Telegraph, a U.K.-based newspaper, that noted Ager-Hanssen helps “eccentric billionaires” facing legal issues and that he has a history of covert recordings.

Last week, Roche’s former partners asserted in a court filing that Ager-Hanssen is a “‘conflict management’ specialist” who was hired by Dfinity to spy on Roche. The filing was made in the firm’s ongoing class action against Dfinity for alleged securities fraud and market manipulation.

“The publicly available evidence establishes” Dfinity is behind the Crypt Leaks site, the firm added, noting that on the same day the Crypto Leaks domain was registered, Dfinity’s CEO had tweeted he was “coming for’’ those who attacked the ICP token.

Neither Dfinity nor its outside counsel responded to repeated requests for comment from Bloomberg Law.

In a phone interview, Ager-Hanssen denied Roche’s accusation, claiming he’s never met Williams and that he did not know about the surreptitious recordings. He said he suspected they were arranged by the consultant. He said he has not spoken to the man since the meetings —and can’t be sure Villavicencio de Aguilar wasn’t an alias.

Still, Ager-Hanssen hasn’t shied from the attention, celebrating Roche’s downfall. “Kyle Roche dragged me into this by lying about facts,” he tweeted on Aug. 30, a day after Roche accused him of being behind the recordings.

Bloomberg Law has been unable to reach the consultant or confirm his name and occupation. Emails sent to an address he used with Ager-Hanssen and others were not returned.

The disclosure of the recordings could be in violation of privacy laws in Britain, including the 2018 Data Protection Act.

Two weeks ago, Roche’s partners severed ties with him and moved to rename the firm Freedman Normand Friedland LLP.

“We are focused on continuing to provide our clients with top quality representation and are proud of the firm’s accomplishments to date,” a spokeswoman said in their only public comment. “We wish Kyle the best in his future endeavors.”

Out On His Own

Roche has since established his own practice, Kyle Roche P.A., according to an Oct. 20 court filing. He continues to represent clients in some individual matters.

Like his ex-colleagues, Roche is vying to remain counsel in the case against Wright, which is now on appeal. Wright, too, has moved to disqualify Roche and his former firm.

It’s unclear if Roche or his former firm are taking more steps to bolster their claims that people from Dfinity were behind the recordings. But details are likely to emerge in the coming weeks; a California judge has scheduled a Jan. 12 hearing on Dfinity’s motion to disqualify the law firm from its class action case.

By then, nearly a year will have passed since the fateful trip that changed Roche’s path.

“You can have 15 minutes of fame and you can have 15 minutes of infamy,” said Jan Jacobowitz, a University of Miami law professor and legal ethics adviser. “He may have loyal clients that are going to stay with him. It’s always hard to measure how long public sentiment will last.”",,3 hours ago,"['labs', 'roches', 'ava', 'litigation', 'crypto', 'agerhanssen', 'firm', 'roche', 'legal', 'law']"

2022-10-31 06:40:18.688173,ABC,Pushing Barriers charity calls for more support to help refugee kids play sport,"Young people are encouraged to dream, to set limitless goals before the reality of adult life has a chance to tether them.

For 17 year-old Ajak Jongkuch-Ayuen football has long been the bedrock of those dreams.

""As long as I can remember, I used to play soccer all the time,"" he says.

In 2017, Ajak made the long journey with his family from a refugee camp in Kakuma, Kenya, to Australia, settling in Goodna, west of Brisbane.

His younger brother Maler sums up the difference in how the world game is played at their football club in Darra compared to Kakuma.

""When I was back in Africa it was just a free-for-all.""

Older brother David, who was 22 when the family moved to Australia, says resources in Kakuma were limited.

""I used to have a pair of boots, but they weren't even my boots,"" he says.

Brothers Ajak, Maler and David Jongkuch-Ayuen moved to Australia in 2017. ( ABC News: Alice Pavlovic )

David, who is studying social work, has now started his own charity that sends boots back to Kakuma.

He says sport can be ""crucial"" to feeling a part of the Australian social fabric.

""For us who have come from overseas and left family and friends, we have to kind of rebuild again,"" he says.

""It's very important because back in Africa the kids kind of just go outside and play, but here in Australia it is different.""

While there are more opportunities for development and training in Australia, they come at a cost.

'A user-pays system' emerging

Tracy Tucker is the founder and CEO of Pushing Barriers, a program doing its best to help kids with refugee backgrounds to access organised sports in Brisbane.

""We started five years ago when we realised kids with a refugee background weren't getting the opportunity to play at clubs,"" she says.

""Many of the kids didn't have the capacity to play at clubs because their parents didn't have the money to pay the club fees and transport was also quite a big issue.

""Many of the families didn't have cars or didn't have the capacity to take them to training and games.""

The work done by the program is designed to take the load off parents as much as possible. Club fees are covered and players are driven to and from training and games by volunteer drivers.

Pushing Barriers supports 81 players.

Just over half of them play at Darra Centenary Stormers.

Club president Belinda Fisher says the Stormers reduce the cost for Pushing Barriers players to ""the bare minimum to cover costs"".

She sees a worrying trend in football towards prioritising fees over pure talent at representative levels.

""I feel really sad that it is coming to that, it becomes a user-pays system, particularly for some of the more elite levels,"" Ms Fisher says.

""The more you can pay, it seems to be the higher you can play.""

Club fees often cost as much as $500 per player for junior club play, but David says cost is not the only barrier for kids with a refugee background, many of whom come from large families trying to find their feet.

""It's very hard — I can speak from my position — basically I get up and go to [university], in the afternoons I go to work. Mum just the other day had to get her licence,"" he says.

""So it was really hard to get the boys to soccer and stuff like that.""

Both Ajak and Maler are supported by Pushing Barriers.

""It feels really amazing. I'm scoring goals, winning — that feels really good,"" Maler says.

""They gave me this opportunity to do what I love. I'm really thankful for that,"" Ajak says.

""Shout out to Ms Tracy.""

Football costs have become more and more expensive over the years. ( ABC News: Alice Pavlovic )

Calls for government and clubs to step up

Pushing Barriers relies on volunteers, and Ms Tucker is volunteer-in-chief, working between 20 and 30 hours a week without pay.

She feels comfortable doing this — she loves her work — but knows it isn't sustainable long-term, especially if the program is to be expanded.

While Pushing Barriers is currently limited to the Greater Brisbane area, next year they will expand south to Logan.

""There is a big demand for our program … We've had a waitlist this year,"" Ms Tucker says.

""We have been approached to start our program interstate.

""For Pushing Barriers to grow and go interstate, we would absolutely need more funding in order to pay people.

""We should be paying people in our operational team because they are putting in a huge amount of hours. Funding would be crucial.""

While those at Pushing Barriers relish the opportunity to help where they can, Ms Tucker says there should be ""an overarching policy around making sport accessible to all"", that ensures clubs are doing their part to support families who cannot afford exorbitant fees.

""I think there should be a way that all clubs should be providing discounted fees to those families … I don't believe it should just be the odd club in Brisbane,"" she says.

Ms Fisher says being that ""odd club"" makes Darra Centenary Stormers a special place.

""It's an amazing experience. At the end of the day, I want to see kids on the ground, I want to see them kicking soccer balls, I want to see the joy on their faces,"" she says.

""It brings no greater joy than to provide that opportunity for them.""","Club fees are covered and players are driven to and from training and games by volunteer drivers.

There’s hardly an entity that has received as uniformly awful marks as the Department of Correction, which for seven years has been the subject of grim status reports by Federal Monitor Steve Martin.

Like an employee on probation, the DOC was given a final chance to get its act together by Manhattan Federal Judge Laura Taylor Swain, the same judge who first appointed Martin in 2015 to probe the record of violence and excessive force at the ignoble Rikers Island complex. The DOC had between June and now to prove that it could implement the action plan that it had developed to address the state of crisis that has characterized the jail for decades. The review is in, and it’s not good.

Martin’s latest report, released on Friday, doesn’t mince words, reiterating that “[d]ecades of mismanagement have created a deep-seated culture that is steeped in poor practices, illogical procedures, and little accountability,” which means that “nearly every facet of the jails’ operations, procedures and practices needs to be dismantled and reconstituted.” This total transformation has not been achieved, and people in Rikers keep suffering violence and death.

The monitoring team does commend the DOC for making strides, reserving particular praise for what it views as a much more competent leadership team that has “revealed the beginning of some momentum to resolve these decades-long problems.” The trouble is, the beginning of some momentum is a pretty paltry achievement at a moment where the 17 deaths in custody this year have already surpassed last year’s crisis-level toll and, as the report itself notes, some increases in use of force and assaults that are still not properly investigated.

As the monitors write, whether the leadership can turn things around “remains to be seen.” We don’t have time for more trial and error and uncertainty here. It’s past time for a receiver that can take action without any tether to the rotten old ways.","In most professions, consistently abysmal performance evaluations can be a sign that it’s time to move on.

2022-10-31 11:40:18.949897,Georgia Public Broadcasting,Supreme Court revisits affirmative action in college admissions,"The U.S. Supreme Court returns to the question of affirmative action in higher education on Monday and court wags probably won't be able to resist noting that it's Halloween.

The justices are revisiting decades of precedent upheld over the years by narrow court majorities that included Republican-appointed justices. This time, however, there is every likelihood that the new conservative court will overrule some or all of those precedents.

The baseline for permissible affirmative action programs in higher education was established in 1978. Citing Harvard University as the model, Justice Lewis Powell said that in evaluating applicants for admission, race could not be the determinative factor, but the university could use race as one of many factors, just as it uses other traits — special talents in music, science or athletics, and even the fact that the applicant's parents attended the university.

In announcing his opinion from the bench, Powell stressed that ""in choosing among thousands of academically qualified applicants,"" a university's admissions committee, may ""with a number of criteria in mind,"" pay ""some attention to distribution that should be made among many types and categories of students.""

In a series of cases since then, the court has more or less stuck to that principle, adding that each applicant must be evaluated individually, in a holistic way.

But today Harvard's admission system, cited as a model by Powell, is itself under the judicial microscope, along with the system at the University of North Carolina. UNC, which until the 1950s refused to accept any black applicants, is now widely rated as one of the top three state colleges in the South, though like many other top universities, it struggles to have a genuinely diverse student population. Just 8% of the undergraduate student population is African American in a state that is 21% Black.

The two cases overlap. Because UNC is a state school, the question is whether its affirmative-action program violates the 14th Amendment's guarantee to equal protection of the law. And even though Harvard is a private institution, it still is covered by federal anti-discrimination laws because it accepts federal money for a wide variety of programs.

What constitutes racial discrimination?

Ultimately, at the heart of both cases is the same principle: what constitutes racial discrimination?

On one side is Students for Fair Admissions, an organization founded by legal activist Edward Blum, who for decades has fought what he sees as racial preferences in school admissions and in other spheres as well.

""What is happening on college campuses today is that applicants are treated differently because of their race and ethnicity,"" he says. ""Some are given a thumbs up. Some are given a thumbs down.""

On the other side, Harvard and UNC contend that in addition to academic excellence, they aim for a student body that is demographically diverse, and that in evaluating the strengths of each candidate, an admissions committee ""need not ignore a candidate's race any more than it does a candidate's home state, national origin, family background, or special achievements.""

This holistic approach to college admissions is used by a huge variety of colleges, large and small, including the U.S. military academies. Among the many academic institutions that have filed briefs supporting affirmative action are 57 Catholic colleges and universities, including Notre Dame, Georgetown, and Holy Cross. And there are more briefs filed by 68 of the largest corporations in the country, and a brief filed by a long list of retired three- and four-star generals and admirals attesting to the need for racial diversity in the upper echelons of the military. They say that the lack of racial diversity in the officer corps during the Vietnam War led to enormous tensions, and even violence between the largely white officer corps and the largely black and Hispanic enlisted men, sometimes compromising the war effort.

An uphill task at a conservative court

That said, the Supreme Court's new conservative super-majority presents a daunting legal mountain for UNC and Harvard to climb. Three of the more senior conservatives — Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito — have previously dissented when the court upheld affirmative-action programs, and they are now joined by three relatively new Trump appointees.

So, academic institutions are making, or at least emphasizing, some new arguments, focused on the conservative doctrine of ""originalism"" and what the ""original intent"" was of the men who wrote the Fourteenth Amendment and its guarantee to ""equal protection of the laws.""

The court's newest member and the first African American woman named to the court, Biden-appointee Ketanji Brown Jackson, pointed to that history during oral arguments in a different case about race earlier this month.

""When I drilled down to that level of analysis, it became clear to me that the Framers themselves adopted the equal protection clause...in a race-conscious way,"" she said. ""I don't think that the historical record establishes that the founders believed that race neutrality or race blindness was required.""

Indeed, Harvard and UNC point to colorblind language that was originally proposed for the Fourteenth Amendment, and rejected by Congress. And they note that the same Congress that passed the Fourteenth Amendment after the Civil War also adopted race-conscious laws giving special benefits to African Americans in areas from education to land distribution.

SFFA counters that the whole idea of the Fourteenth Amendment was colorblindness, and the organization repeatedly cites the Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education, declaring racial segregation of public schools unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.

""The Constitution and our civil rights laws forbid the consideration of race in higher education,"" says SFFA's Blum.

But Harvard co-counsel William Lee replies that SFFA's use of Brown turns the court's 1954 schools case ""on its head."" Brown, he says, dealt with the exclusion of students based solely on their race, not with actions aimed at bringing the races together.

The Harvard case will be the second one argued Monday, with one justice missing. Justice Jackson has recused herself because she sat on the Harvard Board of Overseers during part of this litigation. She is hardly the only justice with Harvard connections. Four of the justices — including Jackson and the chief justice, attended Harvard college or law school, or both. Justice Brett Kavanaugh taught there, as did Justice Elena Kagan, who in addition served as dean of the law school for six years. But none, except Jackson, has had anything to do with the Harvard case.

Harvard's Jewish quota

SFFA's lawsuit against Harvard is based in significant part on the challengers assertion that Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans, who have, on average, better standardized test scores and grades than any other ethnic group, including whites.

SFFA's Blum points to Harvard's history of limiting the number of Jews, by imposing a Jewish quota. ""Today at Harvard,"" he maintains, ""Asians are in effect the new Jews.""

Blum's initial filings in the case relied heavily on the work of Berkeley professor Jerome Karabel, author of ""The Chosen,"" about the Jewish quotas at Harvard, Yale and Princeton in the 1900s. But Karabel disputes Blum's thesis, and declined to work on the current case.

Karabel observes that there is a ""critical difference"" between the reviled Jewish quotas, which dramatically drove down the number of Jews on Ivy League campuses from the 1920's up to the early 1960's, and today's approach.

""Nothing like that has happened"" with Asian Americans at Harvard, he says. In fact, Asian American enrollments ""have consistently risen"" — risen so much that the 28% of the entering class at Harvard this year self-identifies as Asian American, while the country's overall Asian population is 7.2%.

Consequences far beyond Harvard

Much of Harvard's argument on Monday will rest heavily on the fact that SFFA's charges of discrimination were tested in court during a 15-day trial during which Harvard's Dean of Admissions and members of the admissions committee were subjected to cross examination, and hundreds of thousands of emails were produced for examination.

Harvard says in its briefs that academic excellence, though ""necessary,"" is ""only one factor."" Professor Karabel notes that Harvard's size is ""almost exactly the size it was in the 1960s."" But the number of applicants has mushroomed over and over again. Harvard's brief points out that of the 35,000 applicants competing for 1,600 slots in the class of 2019, 2,700 had perfect verbal SAT scores; 3,700 had perfect math SAT scores, and more than 8,000 had perfect Grade Point Averages.

Indeed, the trial judge in the case, Judge Allison Burroughs was, in her youth, a failed applicant to Harvard. But after the trial, her conclusion, upheld by the appeals court, was that there was ""no evidence"" of discrimination against Asian Americans. A federal judge in North Carolina reached a similar conclusion for UNC.

If the Supreme Court throws out its prior rulings on affirmative action, or in other ways further limits them, expect enormous ripple effects, well beyond the question of college admissions or admissions at selective primary and secondary public schools like Boston Latin or Bronx High School of Science.

Harvard co-counsel Lee says that if the court repudiates affirmative action in college admissions, race-conscious policies in other areas, including employment, could be challenged next.

""It's going to open up a Pandora's box across the country and across institutions and industries,"" Lee says.

That said, affirmative action policies are not like abortion; they do not have the same level of public support. Indeed, in 2020 liberal California, by a 57% majority, voted not to reinstate affirmative action in the state's public colleges and universities. Other polls indicate similar, though sometimes contradictory results. For instance, a recent Washington Post-Schar School poll found that 6 in 10 Americans say race shouldn't be considered in college admissions. But an equally robust majority endorsed programs to boost racial diversity on campuses.

For Blum, race-conscious policies are not a new question. Even as he brought a decades-long challenge to affirmative action in college admissions, he engineered a successful challenge to a key provision of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act. By a 5-to-4 vote the Supreme Court struck down the section of the law that had required areas with a history of race discrimination at the polls to pre-clear with the Justice Department any changes in voting procedures.

Asked what is next on his agenda, Blum is coy, declaring, ""I don't have anything planned. I'm 70 years old...I'm getting near the end of my tether.""

But last year he formed a new organization, which has already filed two lawsuits to challenge diversity goals on corporate boards.

This holistic approach to college admissions is used by a huge variety of colleges, large and small, including the U.S. military academies.
Harvard co-counsel Lee says that if the court repudiates affirmative action in college admissions, race-conscious policies in other areas, including employment, could be challenged next.
That said, affirmative action policies are not like abortion; they do not have the same level of public support.

2022-10-31 05:40:18.951953,The Salt Lake Tribune,Reports: Big 12 finalizes media rights deal with ESPN and Fox worth over $2 billion,"New Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark told anybody that would listen in recent weeks that his conference’s new media rights deal would be more lucrative than the one before it.

He flew to New York and Kansas City in what amounted to a media blitz, touting what he thought would be a stable conference long after heavyweights Texas and Oklahoma leave for the SEC in 2025.

“I know the media felt that we would go backwards with the loss of Texas and Oklahoma,” Yormark said on Oct. 18. “But as I said last week in New York, and I’ll continue to say, this conference is bigger than any two institutions. And I think our [TV] partners understand that. They see the value.”

This weekend, it appears he was right.

The Big 12 struck a six-year contract extension with ESPN and Fox worth $2.2 billion, as was first reported by the Sports Business Journal and later multiple other outlets.

Running through the 2030-31 season, Big 12 members will reportedly receive an average of $31.7 million annually — up from an average of $28 million on the last deal. This does not include revenue from potential bowl game payouts, College Football Playoff revenue and NCAA revenue. With those figures included, annual revenue could approach $50 million per school, according to multiple reports.

Notably, for incoming member BYU, the Cougars will become a full-share member until its third year in the league.

Beyond just the revenue number, Yormark achieved two other major goals in this media rights deal. His first was to leapfrog the Pac-12 in getting a deal done, giving his conference more stability in conference realignment. And the second was to have this deal be short enough to where the Big 12 will be at the negotiating table early when the next round of talks begin.

As for the first objective, Yormark purposefully brought the Big 12 to the negotiating table almost two years earlier than contractually expected, in the spring of 2024.

Knowing the Pac-12 had pushed up its negotiations, the Big 12 did not want to be cut out of the money. Also, in securing a media rights deal first, Yormark could tether together his conference members as the threat of conference realignment looms. Not to mention, having a firm revenue number is a powerful negotiating tool to lure potential new members into the Big 12.

A pro rata clause is expected to be in this deal, according to The Athletic, in the event that the conference expands.

On the second objective, this deal ending in 2031 would once again put the Big 12 in negotiations before both the SEC and ACC renew their deals. The Big 12 felt it was at a disadvantage this cycle by being last to the negotiating table out of the major conferences. It wanted to change that in the next round if possible.

For BYU, a team moving away from football independence into the Big 12 in all sports, the annual revenue will be a large increase from its current margins. The exact increase, because BYU is a private school, is not known.

Overall, the addition of BYU, Cincinnati, Houston and UCF to the Big 12 appeared to help the conference more than originally thought. When former commissioner Bob Bowlsby added those four teams, it was still widely believed the conference would take a significant hit in average revenue because of the Texas and Oklahoma departure.

The Big 12 will still see a decrease in revenue from the last year of its current television contract (when both schools are in the league) and the first year of its new deal (when the two national brands depart). However, the decrease is less than expected, per the Sports Business Journal. And the average annual revenue over the lifetime of the deal is more, according to multiple reports.

At one point in 2021, Bowlsby openly feared the new media rights deal without Texas and OU could cut the revenue by 50%.

2022-10-31 03:40:18.953687,Yardbarker.com,All You Need To Know Before Picking The Best Crypto Gambling Sites In 2022,"Today, opportunities to deposit and withdraw with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have significantly increased the number of online traders. This method’s ease and rapid response have influenced the popularity of platforms such as crypto gambling sites. However, gamblers now recognize these Bitcoin gambling sites as the best option to place their wagers.

While there is a wealth of information about these platforms available online today, it is still important to conduct adequate research before choosing one. Thankfully, The top crypto gambling sites typically have similar characteristics, so players can easily detect a fake one. The following paragraphs cover everything you need to know before picking some of the best crypto gambling sites in 2022.

About The Crypto Gambling Sites Transactions, Games, and Bonuses

It would help if you learned about the deposit and withdrawal procedures before deciding on a casino platform to play on. This offer is due to the possibility that such platforms only offer withdrawal choices in your home currency, even though you may be able to deposit on them in multiple currencies.

This step suggests that even while you can use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Tether, and Doge to play and withdraw, you might not be able to start in the same currencies. Transaction costs and unforeseen losses could emerge from this. The world’s central banks and payment institutions often take three to five business days before completing the transactions. However, this duration delays deposits, withdrawals, and gambling.

The best thing about these options is that transfers proceed swiftly, especially when it’s a deposit. However, the platform may still possess excessive withdrawal times as certain casinos use simple means of processing transactions to prevent data loss.

You may cash out your winnings at the top Bitcoin gambling sites without visiting another website or platform. Payment choices are what distinguish crypto gambling sites. In contrast to a casino that only accepts fiat money, they don’t limit their customers to a small number of options.

Casino Games Are Available

Most Bitcoin casino platforms offer a wide range of games, but not all of them are available using cryptocurrencies. These games include Bitcoin slots, roulette, arcade, and table games. Moreover, see the risk and stake profiles for the different games; even though there aren’t as many Bitcoin casinos as regular ones, the available ones are a great selection of games.

Furthermore, people universally acknowledge that players prefer a casino with a wide variety of games, especially ones that offer significant jackpots. As a result, Bitcoin gambling sites feature a far more excellent selection of games with higher return percentages than conventional online casinos. Punters can also easily wager on their favorite games, including slots, blackjack, and poker.

Unique Bonuses and Incentives

Consider the rewards and bonuses that Bitcoin gambling sites offer. You must know the limitations and payout policies for games where you can wager and win prizes depending on your prediction.

Many upscale Bitcoin casinos provide you extra incentives based on how many people are betting on the odds. For instance, Real Madrid would have better reward odds if more wagers were put on Liverpool defeating Real Madrid in a football match. The top platforms may also provide additional deposit bonuses and incentives.

The best Bitcoin gambling sites allow you to grow your wealth instead of losing it. They achieve this by rewarding their customers with significant bonuses. Thanks to these advantages, you can start living a successful life and being financially successful. The following are the top bonuses offered by cryptocurrency casinos:

Bonus funds incentives exclusive to specific cryptocurrencies are offered for withdrawals and deposits.

VIP provides perks with no money down.

Bonuses for deposits

Regulation and Licensing

Even though there are many online Bitcoin casinos and cryptocurrency gambling sites, not all of them are regulated or authorized by the state. Examine customer reviews and the company’s policies before choosing the platform that best satisfies your live casino requirements.

When a forum like this is licensed, it has undergone a thorough review and audit by a regulatory body like the well-known Malta Gaming Authority or the United Kingdom Gaming Authority. This law implies that you won’t have to worry about disappearing when you add money to your platform-based digital wallet. Even when you withdraw money, your transactions are protected and kept secure.

Usability and Accessibility of Mobile Apps

Despite websites, most of the largest Bitcoin casinos and live sportsbook betting systems are often ugly and challenging to use. In addition, only a few of the best cryptocurrency sites provide a mobile app and an engaging online app.

This offer ensures greater mobility while placing bets and makes it simpler to use directly from your phone. While giving their consumers various options, the best Bitcoin casinos put the user experience first.

The top fiat sites use cryptocurrency, especially for players from nations where gambling is not allowed. Therefore, they are eligible for all the advantages and can visit online casinos securely using cryptocurrencies. Contrarily, several digital currency websites accept players from different countries and do not restrict their operations. Furthermore, punters find it easy to process transactions, whether it is deposit or withdrawal.

Closing Thoughts

There are many more reasons to consider adopting a cryptocurrency gambling site for all possible gambling operations. Furthermore, Bitcoin games and offers provide profitable cryptocurrency investment opportunities.

Additionally, you can maintain your privacy and keep a record of your transactions on the blockchain. Therefore, this implies that Bitcoin gambling sites are highly transparent and unchanging.

2022-10-31 11:40:18.964447,CoinGeek,Digital currency trading firm dissolves in UK after alleged scam,"The news about scams and ripoffs in the digital currency industry just keeps on coming.

In September, digital currency trading firm PGI Global U.K. was dissolved by the country’s High Court after allegedly scamming investors out of $709,000. The scam promised investors returns of up to 200%, but when the gains never materialized, they were prevented from withdrawing their funds from the platform.

On October 27, an Official Receiver was appointed to liquidate the company in an update to the case. The firm’s parent company, Praetorian Group International Trading Ltd, was previously shut down by the United States Department of Justice and U.S. Treasury.

Scams, scams, and yet more scams

There are so many scams and ripoffs in the digital currency industry that CoinGeek had to start a series called the Crypto Crime Cartel to keep track of them.

What many newcomers don’t know is that some of the biggest players in the industry and some of the largest firms have been involved in all manner of shady dealings, from money laundering to insider trading and worse. Many of the industry’s leaders have been outspoken advocates of anarchy and unchecked criminality, yet millions of newcomers entrust them with vast amounts of money every year. The Crypto Crime Cartel series aims to shine a light on this.

In fact, while it is not yet widely known, BTC itself is a sort of scam, passing itself off as Bitcoin while being anything but. Yes, it’s that insane: the largest digital currency by market cap, which Wall Street tycoons such as Michael Saylor have bought into wholesale, is a giant Ponzi scheme destined to collapse someday and create a tidal wave of financial loss and suffering.

Thankfully, as a growing list of firms like PGI Global U.K. are checked and shut down by regulators, more people are waking up and realizing that all isn’t as it seems in ‘crypto.’ There’s still time to get out, and as current market prices reflect, many people are heading for the exits while there’s still some liquidity.

A heartbreaking catalog of carnage and chaos

Looking back over the past several years in the digital currency industry reveals heartbreak on a scale barely imaginable. Financial predators of all kinds have fleeced innocent speculators hoping to catch a break. Here are just a few examples.

Earlier in 2022, algorithmic stablecoin UST collapsed, causing investors to lose billions overnight. Terra founder Do Kwon allegedly moved millions worth of digital currency shortly before the crash and is currently refusing to cooperate with law enforcement.

Crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital unraveled shortly after the UST collapse after borrowing billions of dollars in bad faith to run what is close to, if not a direct, Ponzi scheme. Once again, the founders refuse to cooperate with law enforcement, forcing lawyers for liquidators to subpoena them on Twitter (NASDAQ: TWTR).

Several digital currency lending platforms went under, taking billions in user deposits with them. Firms like Voyager Digital froze user accounts overnight. The biggest by far was Celsius Network. Chief Executive Officer Alex Mashinsky took the time to cash out millions of dollars in CEL tokens amidst the chaos, leaving users holding the bag with no relief in sight.

This is just a snapshot of the most recent dishonest behavior by those involved in the digital currency space. While it can’t be said yet that any of the above scenarios were outright scams of the type PGI Global U.K. allegedly was, this will be determined in due course. These examples nonetheless show the corruption and callous disregard for users at the heart of the industry.

The net is closing in, and the law is cracking down

The shutdown of PGI Global U.K. is just the latest in a long string of crackdowns by regulators and law enforcement worldwide. Many digital currency scams have been shut down before, and top firms like FTX, Binance, and stablecoin issuer Tether are currently under investigation by regulators ranging from the Texas Securities Exchange Commission to the U.S. Department of Justice.

At CoinGeek, we’ve been practicing for years that all of this would happen. While those making money from the shell game have done everything possible to discredit us and silence us, the truth is becoming undeniable. Regulators are enforcing existing laws and passing new ones, the Wild West era is coming to a close, and there’s a long line of CEOs and executives likely heading to jail.

Follow CoinGeek’s Crypto Crime Cartel series, which delves into the stream of groups—a from BitMEX to Binance, Bitcoin.com, Blockstream, ShapeShift, Coinbase, Ripple,

Ethereum, FTX and Tether—who have co-opted the digital asset revolution and turned the industry into a minefield for naïve (and even experienced) players in the market.

2022-10-31 05:40:18.988518,Decrypt,Dogecoin Leaps 94% in Weekly Gains Following Elon Musk’s Twitter Acquisition,"As Elon Musk ostensibly set Twitter free from its cage, popular meme coin Dogecoin broke out of the doghouse that is crypto winter.

The coin saw an extended rally following the social media giant's acquisition by the world’s richest man, briefly doubling in value to 14 cents per Doge earlier this week. It now sits at 11 cents as of this writing, up 94% in the past week, according to CoinGecko.

The billionaire’s outsized impact on Dogecoin is nothing new, but the coin eclipsed prices this week not seen since May. Musk has not mentioned the coin since completing his $44 billion purchase of Twitter, but has responded to tweets from Billy Markus, one of the developers behind Dogecoin, multiple times.

In the past week, Dogecoin’s total value has grown from around $8.1 billion to $15.9 billion as of this writing, surpassing coins such as Cardano and Solana, according to CoinGecko. It is now the eighth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

The coin has also seen notable volume on major cryptocurrency exchanges over the past day. Totaling $302 million over the past 24 hours, Dogecoin is currently the third most traded token on Coinbase, accounting for over 14% of the exchange’s total trading volume.

On Binance, trades between stablecoin Tether and Dogecoin totaled $1.8 billion in the past 24 hours, accounting for 10% of the exchanges total trading volume. Exchanges between Dogecoin and Binance USD, the stablecoin native to the trading platform, also crossed $900 million, representing 5% of the exchanges total trading volume.

The coin is still down 84% from an all-time high of 73 cents, set in May of 2021 on the day Musk hosted Saturday Night Live, the late-night television comedy show. The coin took a 35% dive following Musk’s appearance, where he both called Dogecoin “the future of currency,” yet also referred to it as “a hustle.”

The rise in popularity of Dogecoin can be partly attributed to Musk’s multi-year relationship with the token, referenced in numerous tweets and adopted as a method of payment for some products and services Musk’s companies offer.

Some Tesla merchandise is available for purchase through the carmaker’s website using Dogecoin, and The Boring Company accepts the cryptocurrency as a form of payment for using its Las Vegas Loop. In April, Musk also floated the idea of letting Twitter users pay for its premium subscription service, Twitter Blue, using Dogecoin.

Maybe even an option to pay in Doge? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 10, 2022

Musk’s fondness for the cryptocurrency extends back all the way back to 2019, when he tweeted “Dogecoin may be my fav cryptocurrency.” Since then, he’s referenced the coin in sharing multiple memes on the platform he’s just acquired.

Not everyone believes that Musk has acted in good faith when espousing the meme coin. In June, a $258 billion lawsuit was filed against Musk, SpaceX, and Tesla for allegedly pumping the coin.

The closure of Musk’s deal has also impacted other dog-themed coins such as Shiba Inu and Dogechain, up 19% and 100% this week, respectively.","As Elon Musk ostensibly set Twitter free from its cage, popular meme coin Dogecoin broke out of the doghouse that is crypto winter.

2022-10-31 09:40:18.999543,The Motley Fool,Is Shopify Stock a Buy Now?,"Shopify's (SHOP 0.26%) stock price surged 17% on Thursday, Oct. 27, in response to its third-quarter earnings report. The e-commerce service provider's revenue rose 22% year over year to $1.37 billion and beat analysts' estimates by $30 million. Its adjusted net loss narrowed from $103 million to $30 million, or $0.02 per share, which cleared the consensus forecast by $0.05.

Is Shopify finally primed to bounce back after losing roughly three-quarters of its value this year? Let's review the company's main challenges, current growth rates, and valuations to see whether the stock is worth buying again.

What happened to Shopify?

Shopify's platform allows businesses to set up their own e-commerce sites, process payments, fulfill orders, and manage their marketing campaigns. It's a popular option for businesses that don't want to tether themselves to a large online marketplace like Amazon (AMZN -6.80%).

Shopify's growth in gross merchandise volume (GMV), gross payment volume (GPV), and total revenue accelerated significantly in 2020 as the pandemic forced more businesses to sell their products online. However, its growth decelerated over the past two years as the pandemic passed and those tailwinds dissipated.

Metric First 9 Months of 2022 2021 2020 2019 GMV growth (YOY) 12% 47% 96% 49% GPV growth (YOY) 24% 59% 110% 55% Revenue growth (YOY) 20% 57% 86% 47%

Many of Shopify's merchants also relied heavily on Meta Platforms' Facebook and Instagram to advertise their products. Apple's privacy changes on iOS affected those targeted ads and could also impact its near-term revenue growth.

Shopify didn't provide clear-cut guidance for the rest of the year, but it predicted its GMV growth would ""outperform the broader U.S. retail market"" in the fourth quarter. That's even as the stronger dollar, higher inflation, and rising interest rates ""continue to negatively affect the consumer's purchasing power of discretionary goods and services."" Analysts expect its revenue to rise 19% to $5.5 billion this year and grow another 23% to $6.8 billion in 2023.

Investors are more worried about its margins

Shopify has been ramping up its spending as its revenue growth slows down. It acquired 6 River Systems in 2019 to strengthen its first-party logistics network and acquired the influencer marketing start-up Dovetale and the logistics company Deliverr earlier this year. Those acquisitions -- which expanded its lower-margin merchant solutions segment instead of its higher-margin subscription services segment -- compressed Shopify's gross margins and caused it to turn unprofitable again on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis.

Metric First 9 Months of 2022 2021 2020 2019 Gross margin 50.6% 53.8% 52.6% 54.9% Operating income ($634 million) $269 million $90 million ($141 million) Net income ($2.84 billion) $2.91 billion $320 million ($125 million)

Analysts expect Shopify to post a whopping net loss of $3.08 billion this year, followed by a narrower net loss of $807 million in 2023. But it's unlikely to break even anytime soon -- and all that red ink has made it an unappealing investment as interest rates continue to rise. To make matters worse, Shopify still faces fierce competition from similar e-commerce service providers like BigCommerce, Adobe's Magento, and Amazon's Selz. The saturation of this market could ultimately limit Shopify's pricing power and make it even tougher to narrow its losses.

Is Shopify's stock getting too cheap to ignore?

Shopify's stock currently trades at less than five times next year's sales. That price-to-sales ratio might seem reasonable, but it still isn't a screaming bargain compared to its e-commerce peers. BigCommerce, which is growing at a comparable rate to Shopify, trades at three times next year's sales. MercadoLibre and Pinduoduo, both growing faster than Shopify, also trade at about three times next year's sales.

Therefore, I believe Shopify's stock could still easily lose another 40% of its value -- which would put it just above its initial public offering (IPO) price of $17 from 2015 -- before it's considered too cheap to ignore. I don't think Shopify is doomed since it was still sitting on $4.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the third quarter. But I also wouldn't rush to chase its post-earnings pop when so many other high-quality e-commerce stocks are still on sale.","Let's review the company's main challenges, current growth rates, and valuations to see whether the stock is worth buying again.

2022-10-31 09:40:19.297523,Nasdaq,Is Shopify Stock a Buy Now?,"Shopify's (NYSE: SHOP) stock price surged 17% on Thursday, Oct. 27, in response to its third-quarter earnings report. The e-commerce service provider's revenue rose 22% year over year to $1.37 billion and beat analysts' estimates by $30 million. Its adjusted net loss narrowed from $103 million to $30 million, or $0.02 per share, which cleared the consensus forecast by $0.05.

Is Shopify finally primed to bounce back after losing roughly three-quarters of its value this year? Let's review the company's main challenges, current growth rates, and valuations to see whether the stock is worth buying again.

What happened to Shopify?

Shopify's platform allows businesses to set up their own e-commerce sites, process payments, fulfill orders, and manage their marketing campaigns. It's a popular option for businesses that don't want to tether themselves to a large online marketplace like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).

Shopify's growth in gross merchandise volume (GMV), gross payment volume (GPV), and total revenue accelerated significantly in 2020 as the pandemic forced more businesses to sell their products online. However, its growth decelerated over the past two years as the pandemic passed and those tailwinds dissipated. Metric First 9 Months of 2022 2021 2020 2019 GMV growth (YOY) 12% 47% 96% 49% GPV growth (YOY) 24% 59% 110% 55% Revenue growth (YOY) 20% 57% 86% 47%

Many of Shopify's merchants also relied heavily on Meta Platforms' Facebook and Instagram to advertise their products. Apple's privacy changes on iOS affected those targeted ads and could also impact its near-term revenue growth.

Shopify didn't provide clear-cut guidance for the rest of the year, but it predicted its GMV growth would ""outperform the broader U.S. retail market"" in the fourth quarter. That's even as the stronger dollar, higher inflation, and rising interest rates ""continue to negatively affect the consumer's purchasing power of discretionary goods and services."" Analysts expect its revenue to rise 19% to $5.5 billion this year and grow another 23% to $6.8 billion in 2023.

Investors are more worried about its margins

Shopify has been ramping up its spending as its revenue growth slows down. It acquired 6 River Systems in 2019 to strengthen its first-party logistics network and acquired the influencer marketing start-up Dovetale and the logistics company Deliverr earlier this year. Those acquisitions -- which expanded its lower-margin merchant solutions segment instead of its higher-margin subscription services segment -- compressed Shopify's gross margins and caused it to turn unprofitable again on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis. Metric First 9 Months of 2022 2021 2020 2019 Gross margin 50.6% 53.8% 52.6% 54.9% Operating income ($634 million) $269 million $90 million ($141 million) Net income ($2.84 billion) $2.91 billion $320 million ($125 million)

Analysts expect Shopify to post a whopping net loss of $3.08 billion this year, followed by a narrower net loss of $807 million in 2023. But it's unlikely to break even anytime soon -- and all that red ink has made it an unappealing investment as interest rates continue to rise. To make matters worse, Shopify still faces fierce competition from similar e-commerce service providers like BigCommerce, Adobe's Magento, and Amazon's Selz. The saturation of this market could ultimately limit Shopify's pricing power and make it even tougher to narrow its losses.

Is Shopify's stock getting too cheap to ignore?

Shopify's stock currently trades at less than five times next year's sales. That price-to-sales ratio might seem reasonable, but it still isn't a screaming bargain compared to its e-commerce peers. BigCommerce, which is growing at a comparable rate to Shopify, trades at three times next year's sales. MercadoLibre and Pinduoduo, both growing faster than Shopify, also trade at about three times next year's sales.

Therefore, I believe Shopify's stock could still easily lose another 40% of its value -- which would put it just above its initial public offering (IPO) price of $17 from 2015 -- before it's considered too cheap to ignore. I don't think Shopify is doomed since it was still sitting on $4.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the third quarter. But I also wouldn't rush to chase its post-earnings pop when so many other high-quality e-commerce stocks are still on sale.

2022-10-31 11:40:19.299668,Complex,Evan Peters Says He Spent ‘Months’ in Character as Jeffrey Dahmer While Filming Hit Netflix Series,"Evan Peters detailed the elaborate process that went into his portrayal of Jeffrey Dahmer for the Netflix series Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story during a panel over the weekend.

Peters spent four months preparing for the role, taking into account every single detail of Dahmer’s physicality to ensure that his portrayal was as accurate as possible. “He has a very straight back. He doesn’t move his arms when he walks, so I put weights on my arms to see what that felt like,” he explained, per Variety. “I wore the character shoes with lifts in them, his jeans, his glasses, I had a cigarette in my hand at all times.”

Peters admitted he initially wasn’t sure about accepting the role of what he considered to be an “incredibly dark” character. “I really went back and forth on whether I should do it or not,” he said. “I knew it was going to be incredibly dark and an incredible challenge.” However, once he took on the role, Peters went deep, and according to series co-creator Ryan Murphy, “basically stayed in this character, as difficult as it was, for months.”

Peters’ co-star, Niecy Nash, said she tried to approach Peters when filming started, but noticed he was already “in his process.” While she wanted to respect his approach, Nash admitted she also kept him in her prayers because she understood the emotional weight that comes with playing such a challenging character.

“I wanted to respect that and I wanted to keep him there,” Nash explained. “I prayed for you a lot, for real, because this is weighty. And when you stay in it, and you’re tethered to the material, like bone to marrow, your soul is troubled at some point. And I could see him getting tired. I just said, ‘Well, I’m just gonna make sure I keep him in my prayers, because this is a lot and he wants to do it justice.’”

“I wanted all this stuff, these external things, to be second nature when we were shooting, so I watched a lot of footage and I also worked with a dialect coach to get down his voice,” Peters said. “The way that he spoke, it was very distinct and he had a dialect. So I also went off and created this 45-minute audio composite, which was very helpful. I listened to that every day, in hopes of learning his speech patterns, but really, in an attempt to try to get into his mindset and understand that each day that we were shooting.”

Peters called it an “exhaustive search,” while he was trying to find Dahmer’s “private moments,” the times where he “didn’t seem self conscious, so you could get a glimpse into how he behaved prior to these interviews and being in prison.”","Evan Peters detailed the elaborate process that went into his portrayal of Jeffrey Dahmer for the Netflix series Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story during a panel over the weekend.

2022-10-31 04:40:19.310584,CoinGeek,Turkey’s central bank set to launch state-backed digital currency in 2023,"Turkey has embraced central bank digital currencies (CBDC) after several months of deliberating over them. Now, the results are in, and the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has confirmed that it is eyeing a 2023 launch for the digital iteration of the lira.

The announcement was revealed in Turkey’s Presidential Annual Program for 2023, with the Strategy and Budget Directorate highlighting plans for the CBDC launch. According to the budget document, financial provision has been made for a “blockchain-based digital central bank money to be implemented.”

The funds will be used by the CBRT, the Ministry of Treasury, and TUBITAK, the country’s scientific and technological agency. Three action points for the CBDC development were highlighted in the document, with the first being the commencement of tests for using the digital lira for payments.

The second ambit of the CBDC exploration is the “integration of digital Turkish lira systems with digital identity and FAST systems within the scope of research and development.” Lastly, commercial banks will be brought into the fold in the testing of a wholesale CBDC offering.

Several reasons have been cited for the renewed interest in the launch of CBDCs. Top of the list is the need to streamline international transactions through a cross-border CBDC and to reach the unbanked 40% of Turkey’s population.

Research for Turkey’s CBDC is not a flash in the pan, as back in 2021, the CBRT carried out a successful proof-of-concept stage which led to the participation of technology stakeholders. The trio of ASELSAN, HAVELSAN, and TUBITAK-BILGEM were selected as technology stakeholders, while the banking regulator created the “Digital Turkish Lira Collaboration Platform.”

The success of the CBDC is in doubt

Turkey’s foray towards CBDC development may not be an instant hit to the country’s 80 million citizens. The nation has had to endure a 60% devaluation of its currency amid galloping inflation and other economic challenges, prompting citizens to turn en masse to digital assets.

Nearly eight million Turks have turned to stablecoin Tether (USDT), BTC, and other virtual currencies to hedge against inflation. Analysts doubt the central bank’s methods will trigger usage of the incoming CBDC when faith in the currency is at an all-time low.

Nigeria, a country with similar economic indices to Turkey, launched its own CBDC in 2021. So far, adoption rates have been below par as the central bank runs out of options to encourage usage.

Enabling its usage in transnational trade may be the ace in the sleeves of the Turkish central bank to lure users to its CBDC.

David Schwartz, Ripple’s chief technology officer, has defended XRP’s price performance in a recent tweet.

After a disgruntled investor called the cryptocurrency’s price “a disgrace,” Schwartz explained that the Ripple-affiliated token is actually performing in line with other major cryptocurrencies.

The Ripple executive has noted that one’s perception of XRP’s price performance depends on a specific timeframe.

Schwartz has pointed to the fact that XRP has outperformed both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on a year-to-date basis. For instance, ETH is down, but XRP is down 45%.

However, it should be noted that XRP is still down a staggering 86.41% from its all-time high that was reached all the way back in January 2018. It is one of the few major cryptocurrencies that failed to reach new peaks during the latest bull market cycle.

Yet, despite facing plenty of legal uncertainty due to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple, XRP managed to remain among the leading cryptocurrencies.

According to data provided by CoinMarketCap, it is currently valued at an impressive $23.2 billion, which makes it the sixth-biggest cryptocurrency (behind only Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, BNB, and USD Coin).

Many of the proponents of the controversial cryptocurrency believe that a potentially positive outcome in the Ripple case could be a major tailwind for the token.","The architect of the XRP Ledger has defended the sluggish price performance of the sixth-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalizationDavid Schwartz, Ripple’s chief technology officer, has defended XRP’s price performance in a recent tweet.

2022-10-30 12:40:19.332841,CEOWORLD magazine,Frontline Worker Engagement Should Differ From Desk Worker Engagement — Here’s How,"Now, more than ever, employee engagement is critical for business success. But frontline workers are often left out of the conversation, which can have a significant ripple effect throughout an organization. To keep your deskless employees connected to and engaged with your company’s goals, follow these three steps.

Employee engagement is shrinking, according to Gallup’s latest poll. At the same time, active worker disengagement is inching upward. Businesses still have time to implement employee engagement strategies before the situation worsens. One population to focus on first is frontline workers.

Currently, frontline workers make up 80% of the global workforce. These are the deskless workers, the ones who carry out a lot of work, including customer-facing positions. Because they’re not tethered to traditional workspaces, they’re at greater risk of experiencing disengagement than other types of employees. Often, frontline workers have little to no access to the necessary technologies to receive regular corporate updates. This makes them the last to know about important leadership messages, vital health and safety information, crisis communications, and even routine updates.

Because they’re always one step removed from their employers and colleagues, deskless workers frequently feel like their input is unwanted. As a result, they can begin to disengage over time, not realizing how or why they can be part of their organizations’ missions, visions, and purposes. Therein lies the underpinning of much of the global disengagement we’re seeing today, as well as the significant ripple effect it’s having on businesses of all sizes and sectors.

What are some of the largest repercussions of rampant, unmanaged frontline employee disengagement? The first is a huge cost burden. Gallup estimates that poor disengagement can cost around $7 trillion annually. In the U.S. alone, disengagement can have significant fiscal ripple effects of up to $550 billion yearly.

Another challenge inherent in disengagement is an uptick in employee turnover. More than 63% of businesses report that, despite all the labor shortages, they’re having more trouble holding onto their workers than finding replacements for those who leave. Even if disengaged workers don’t tender their resignations, they can become sources of lowered productivity, decreased profitability, and increased absenteeism. After all, they’re not likely to carry out their roles to the highest standards if they aren’t engaged.

Employee Engagement Solutions: Vital for Thriving Organizations

Businesses can’t afford to have frontline workforces that are unwilling to take responsibility, feel little connection to the employer brand or customer experience, and exhibit all the hallmarks of plummeting morale. By putting the right measures in place, organizations can avoid these problems and enjoy all the benefits of engaged deskless employees.

Just a few of the advantages of providing frontline workers with the right employee engagement solutions include greater ownership and pride, a desire to complete goals more effectively, and a high eagerness to collaborate and problem-solve in both individual and team environments.

What are some methods to help build a motivated, loyal, and engaged frontline staff that’s ready to learn and progress? Below are proven tactics to bump up deskless employee engagement:

Keep frontline workers in the loop.

With limited access to corporate-owned devices and no company email addresses, frontline workers tend to experience a communications gap that more traditional employees don’t. Businesses must provide specific solutions to frontline employees to bridge the gap and ensure they aren’t left out. One such solution is a digital employee engagement platform that employees can access through personal mobile devices. As long as deskless workers have phones, they can stay looped into whatever is happening. Provide the means for frontline workers to be heard.

Frontline employees are the heartbeat of any business thanks to their “boots on the ground” locations and, in many cases, access to customers. Yet, their unique insights are often overlooked by employers. Those insights could significantly impact an organization’s operational, marketing, sales, and other strategies. Eliciting feedback from deskless employees through surveys and other means serves two important purposes. The first is that the employee feels heard and valued (both drivers of employee engagement). The second is that the company taps into concrete, data-driven information on everything from which frontline processes are working (and which aren’t) to what frontline workers need to improve their outcomes. Implement wellness programs that have positive effects on frontline workers.

Investing in all employees is a must for any company that wants to achieve true employee engagement. Wellness initiatives go a long way to improving worker engagement numbers. Employees who are satisfied with their organizations’ benefits and wellness programs are almost two times more likely to stay with the company. And businesses with engaged employees outperform organizations with disengaged employees by a whopping 202% 67% more likely to be engaged in their employers’ missions and goals. Which wellness programs are most useful to activate more widespread staff health and well-being? Employee surveys and other input can help pinpoint specific recommendations to help frontline workers feel their best to bring 100% to their roles.

The employee engagement solutions that work for desk-bound workers — including remote workers — often don’t resonate with their deskless colleagues. Companies that desire to improve engagement across the board should be ready to implement strategies that serve the needs of their frontline employees.

2022-10-31 12:40:19.357311,Yahoo News,Lane Kiffin needles Jimbo Fisher with 'Joker' costume barb after Ole Miss win at Texas A&M,"Ole Miss football coach Lane Kiffin has the jokes. And now he wants a Joker costume for Halloween.

SEC Network reporter and analyst Cole Cubelic asked Kiffin what his Halloween costume might be following the Rebels' 31-28 win at Texas A&M. After some subtle jabs at Aggies coach Jimbo Fisher during game week and the previous offseason, Kiffin had another for the highly-paid SEC West coach to conclude his postgame interview.

""I don't know,"" Kiffin told the SEC Network. ""Maybe Jimbo has a Joker outfit for me.""

Earlier this offseason, Kiffin wondered aloud about the Aggies having to pay ""a luxury tax with how much they paid for their signing class."" Fisher, though not mentioning Kiffin or Alabama coach Nick Saban by name, lamented the ""clown acts"" publicly critical of the Aggies' recruiting tactics.

After the game, Kiffin continued to talk about how he felt about Fisher, and when the Texas A&M coach called Kiffin and Alabama coach Nick Saban ""clowns"" for their comments about the Aggies' No. 1 recruiting class and its relationship with NIL money.

""I don't give you coachspeak. That's real. Most coaches will say no. But that's real,"" Kiffin said. ""When someone attacks you personally and calls you and your good buddy Coach Saban both clowns, you take that personal. I'm glad we won. I guess I can be a clown for Halloween now.""

Earlier this week, Kiffin mentioned that Ole Miss ""got outbid"" for defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin, who went to College Station after last season, and that it was “a common theme with"" Texas A&M.

Earlier in the postgame interview with Cubelic, Kiffin mentioned Ole Miss' 390 rushing yards ""against a bunch of 5-stars. Pretty good.""

Story continues

Kiffin knows Fisher is all but tethered to Texas A&M (3-5, 1-4 SEC) for the next several years with Fisher's guaranteed deal. Fisher's buyout would be $85.95 million if terminated this year.

The Ole Miss coach appears to be fine needling Fisher. Saturday's win in College Station only ensures that it will continue at some point.

2022-10-31 05:40:19.709743,CryptoSlate,"Op-ed: Is SBF a superhero, villain or simply misunderstood by the crypto community?","FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is a controversial figure in the world of crypto, perhaps the most contentious following his recent statements on regulation. Over the past year, SBF has been in the trending section of CryptoSlate’s people directory almost weekly.

SBF, along with his companies Alameda Research and FTX, bailed out both BlockFi and Voyager following the collapse of Terra Luna. He also engaged with Celsius but chose not to invest in them due to holes in the balance sheets to the tune of $2 billion.

Through these activities, a few have hailed SBF as the savior of crypto, while others have pointed to possible personal motivations for his actions. The founder of Solana-based Solend, Rooter, called SBF “a profit maxi: profit at all costs.”

Below I attempt to address ‘What is SBF’s position on regulation?’ and whether he has been misunderstood.

Crypto regulation and SBF

Questions about SBF’s motivation for his public views on crypto regulation have been riding high over the past few weeks. SBF’s comments on DeFi revolved around blocklists, sanctions, consumer protection, hackers, and licensing for DeFi protocols. Most notably, SBF contended that marketing DeFi products to U.S. retail investors would likely require a license and KYC obligations.

Directly, SBF remarked,

“If you host a website that makes it easy for US retail to connect to and trade on a DEX, you would likely have to register as something like a broker-dealer.”

The crypto community is not on board with the requirement of licenses and KYC checks for DeFi, as Erik Voorhees from Bankless wrote in a recent blog post. CryptoSlate covered the response alongside Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy’s take on the situation. Fortune.com referred to the debate as “the battle for crypto’s soul” while describing SBF as “the most powerful man in crypto.”

The dispute spilled over onto Twitter on October 20 when SBF responded by remarking that “he did not feel heard” by Voorhees.

From your original post, it isn't clear where/how you draw the line. I think this is why so many have been upset about. ""Everyone should respect OFAC’s sanctions lists"" Everyone? Every American or all humans? Should a protocol developer from Japan be blocking all Iranians? — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) October 20, 2022

The outcome of the social media sparring match was the pair appearing on the Bankless YouTube channel during a livestream to discuss the issue face-to-face. The conversation is the first high-level public debate between two key industry personalities not to be beholden to 280 characters. As such, it could be viewed as an accurate representation of the significant aspects of the debate.

The conversation was extremely productive and addressed the root of much of the controversy. The following breakdown highlights the major aspects of the discussion and the crucial factors that affect the rest of us in the crypto industry.

SBF on crypto regulation

At the start of the Bankless livestream, SBF directly addressed whether crypto should be regulated. His response began by saying that “parts of it should be and parts of it shouldn’t.”

Several times SBF stipulated that “the details are in the nuances” of the debate. Speaking on nuance, SBF contended there to be two axes by which the community should address crypto regulation.

“How regulated crypto should be” “How thoughtful are we about which parts of it are regulated?”

SBF commented that it is the second axis he cares about the most, giving the example of stablecoins to support his argument. Many have questioned the legitimacy of Tether’s holdings over the years, and some form of oversight as to whether a stablecoin is fully backed is a necessity in SBF’s mind.

The FTX CEO went as far as to say that there should be “really thorough regulation confirming the number of dollars in the bank account is at least as many as the number of tokens.”

However, SBF argued that making a simple transaction in a store using a stablecoin should not require regulatory oversight through a “broker dealer,” a point he viewed as “very important.”

Labeling it as his “core thought,” SBF posited, “We should be really thoughtful about where the regulation comes in and what it does.” He believes that regulation is coming to crypto in the United States, and the debate should focus on which parts should be regulated, not whether they should be regulated at all.

SBF confirmed that he believes that “some of this regulation is definitively good… and it is not just a compromise.” Further, he reasoned that he is “cautiously optimistic” about any upcoming U.S. regulation on crypto.

“I’m optimistic that it will end up striking a balance where it will do a good job of providing a large ratio of customer protection to restriction of commerce.”

Erik Voorhees on crypto regulation

Erik Voorhees replied that requiring stablecoin providers to disclose their exact holdings would be a “higher bar than the Federal Reserve itself already applies.” Unlike the traditional banking system, the crypto industry already uses cryptographic proofs throughout its ecosystem.

“The crypto industry already have a higher standard of what constitutes knowledge, what constitutes proof and so it is a little ironic for people from the traditional financial world imposing on us the need to be proving anything.”

Voorhees contended that crypto is already “heavily regulated” and is subject to laws worldwide. He asserted that it would be his “panacea” for it not to be regulated but that this is not the case, referring to it as “encumbered.” Regulations are a significant factor in the state of traditional finance and the imbalance of the “status quo,” according to Voorhees.

Progressing his argument, Voorhees noted that the industry must ask itself if it wishes to move closer to the traditional world or to build something better. Voorhees believes that transparency within the current financial system is insufficient and asked, “why are we being burdened with additional requirements for transparency when we’re already more transparent.”

Regarding regulation at a high level, Voorhees took a strong stance stating that.

“The moral premises under which these regulations get imposed on us are important. They’re always cast down as if we have these morally prescient individuals in the government that know what’s right and wrong.”

This sentiment is one Voorhees wishes to challenge as the crypto industry is building “more virtuous financial systems than what exists today.”

The DeFi debate

SBF responded to Voorhees by agreeing that some of his posts may have included at least some “lazy choice of wording.” He agreed that DeFi is more transparent when it is entirely on chain but that companies like Celsius were much less regulated and transparent. SBF also clarified that by using the word ‘everyone,’ he meant ‘everyone in the U.S.’ and everyone around the world – a question raised in Voorhees’ original response.

SBF proclaimed,

“I would be excited to see bilateral engagement around ways that we can minimize the amount of collateral damage dealt while making sure to sanction terrorist activity.”

Voorhees level-headedly replied by requesting that OFAC sanctions related to crypto activity come with official “allegations” rather than a direct decree. OFAC sanctions do not require supporting evidence, and DeFi protocols may be required to censor addresses without knowing the exact reason why.

For example, rather than banning crypto use in North Korea, Voorhees argued for more crypto usage in the country to help its citizens break free of financial tyranny.

Voorhees summarized his position on how to engage with governments on crypto regulation by asserting that.

“My ask is that people like Sam who are engaging [with the government] be very careful about what they ask for and where they draw the lines.”

SBF’s opinion that crypto should “remain open and immutable” is one that Voorhees agreed on. However, SBF’s proposal that the front end of DeFi protocols like Aave should perhaps be regulated as a financial institution is where he drew the line.

The FTX CEO denied the assertion that he believes DeFi should be regulated in such a way, stipulating that “a lot of this is just permissionless code.” Therefore, SBF hopes that any U.S. regulations are a “light touch” on DeFi.

However, SBF sees the need for DeFi regulation when currently regulated financial entities like “Schwab” decide to offer DeFi products to its customers.

SBF confirmed that he thinks the most critical aspect of DeFi is that permissionless on-chain code, smart contracts, payments, and validators should be free of regulation, going as far as to call them “sacred.” He is willing to “compromise” on regulation to keep these things free of regulation by accepting regulation for front-end DeFi services. SBF then gave an example definition of an entity subject to regulation based on this compromise.

“A website hosted on a centralized service by an American that targets financial products at American retail back ending on to DeFi but is non-custodial.”

Voorhees responded to SBF’s suggestion by claiming that “the tendency of the regulators is to make the world a darker place no matter what” and that SBF is compromising too readily. His libertarian views appear at odds with SBF’s arguably pragmatic approach to regulation at a fundamental level.

Since the days of Satoshi, the crypto industry has focused solely on a financial system free of regulatory oversight by governments. Voorhees remains true to this vision in his rebuttals toward SBF. However, at this point, does the debate not reduce to a discussion on political grounds rather than objective profiteering? The crypto community is unsure.

Online perception of SBF

A clip of the discussion has been circulating on Twitter in which one Bitcoiner, Duo Nine, asserted, “This guy does not deserve what crypto has to offer. I’d be very careful about anything this guy touches.” The clip shows SBF failing to assert a reasonable rebuttal of Voorhees’s argument that censoring DeFi would be akin to censoring e-mail in the late 90s.

SBF stutters and fails to find the words to respond during the clip, and it ends with a comedy outro mimicking the Larry David show Curb your Enthusiasm. However, the podcast continued at this point, and SBF did find words to showcase that he understood Voorhees’ point of view, as stated earlier in this article.

Wait till the end. 👇#FTX CEO has lost the plot IMO. This guy does not deserve what crypto has to offer. I'd be very careful about anything this guy touches. He should not do interviews either. 😅 pic.twitter.com/a9zs0Jw8va — Duo Nine | YCC (@DU09BTC) October 29, 2022

A source familiar with the matter who asked to remain anonymous stated that the discourse around SBF has been “overblown” and is not in keeping with their experience of the FTX CEO. However, the source confirmed they had many trader friends who “dislike him and avoided trading on FTX as long as possible.”

During the livestream, SBF mirrored the above sentiment, claiming that others have been “misrepresenting pretty grossly what my position is, and I feel like I never said that” in response to a question on the need for compromise in the user interface of DeFi.

SBF confirmed that it is possible that the crypto industry may have to compromise on some aspects of regulation relating to the front end of DeFi protocols that interact with users inside the U.S. However, he also affirmed that he is “not saying thatwe should make happen… those I think would be probably not the right tactics.”

My take on the situation

From his conversation with Voorhees, it is hard to argue that SBF has malicious intent, as he continuously admitted to not knowing if he is correct and was firm that many aspects of crypto are “sacred.”

It is my view that SBF has made suggestions on compromises that could be made to keep on-chain transactions free of regulation that are now being taken as evidence he wants DeFi to be fully regulated.

Whether SBF’s public comments truly reflect his private actions remains to be seen. Yet, while I may not agree with everything SBF has said, I also do not agree with everything Voorhees expressed.

The issue is nuanced, and it is important to ensure an understanding of the opposing viewpoint before going on the attack.

2022-10-31 07:40:19.722574,Auganix.org,DPVR to focus esports with upcoming E4 PCVR device,"In Virtual Reality News

October 31, 2022 – DPVR, a Shanghai-based company specializing in virtual reality (VR) device design and manufacturing, has announced more details on its upcoming VR headset aimed at gamers and consumers.

DPVR states that its soon-to-be announced ‘E4’ device will differ from its previous VR products. The E4 will instead be focused on VR gaming and consumer use and will include features such as inside-out tracking and six degrees of freedom (6DoF) interaction capabilities.

According to DPVR, the field of view (FoV) of its E4 device will also be greater than that of both the newly announced Meta Quest Pro and Pico 4 headsets, which have FoVs of 106° and 105° respectively. The company has not yet specified exactly how much greater the E4’s FoV will be though, but it has stated that it will be pushing to get as many hardcore VR gamers on board with its new device once released. Of course, for gamers, a wider FoV can mean greater immersion in VR gaming experiences.

The E4 will be a tethered VR device that consists of a modular design that DPVR states has been optimized to be more lightweight than other PCVR devices currently on the market. Although, the company has not yet specified exactly how much the device will weigh at this time.

In terms of content, in addition to cooperating with several VR games studios, DPVR has also confirmed that its device will be compatible with SteamVR – the largest content library for VR games. This means that VR gamers using the DPVR E4 device will be able to enjoy nearly 7,000 VR gaming titles available on the Steam platform, from Beat Saber to Half-Life: Alyx, as well as social VR platforms such as VRChat and Rec Room.

Finally, DPVR added that it is also working with partners including NVIDIA, AMD, MSI, and others, as part of the company’s efforts to enter the VR esports market.

“The best way to open up the VR gaming market is to expand and upgrade the existing PC gaming market by adding VR interactions. We are hopeful that by allowing existing PC gamers to experience the increased immersion that VR has to offer, we’ll be able to convert many of them into PCVR gamers. As part of DPVR’s efforts to achieve this and grow the number of PCVR users, we will be focusing our efforts on the VR esports market,” said Derek Liu, VP at DPVR.

Liu continued, “esports events can attract hundreds of millions of players, whether it is from the Legends Pro League (LPL) for League of Legends, to the King Pro League (KPL) for Honor of Kings. VR esports will therefore become a key area of focus and development for DPVR. Although there is still much work to be done with regards to VR esports, we believe that DPVR can cement its place as a VR esports leader with the help of our upcoming E4 device, which we are confident gamers will love.”

2022-10-31 12:40:19.724692,The New Indian Express,Need to get inflation target rates right,"The RBI’s inflation mandate was deemed a gentlemen’s agreement and never meant to be broken. Though the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has the luxury of blaming the 6% breach on supply-side faults like high oil prices, there’s an emerging view that the central bank’s pursuit of price stability needs a revisit. The government and RBI agreed to a status quo during last year’s review following the completion of MPC’s first five-year tenure. But inflation in the post-pandemic era seems tethered to temporary but repeated supply shocks, causing severe food and en­ergy crises seen in re­cent his­tory.

As Deputy Governor Michael Patra has indicated in his speeches, MPC meetings and independent articles, India’s inflation target needs an update. He believes estimates of threshold inflation, beyond which inflation retards growth, worked out to 6% in the pre-pandemic period but now need re-estimation. Others agree that both the 4% target and the tolerance band of 2% on either may be widened to accommodate measurement issues, forecast errors and supply shocks and, lastly, failure to be defined to four as against three consecutive quarters of deviation for monetary policy to remain credible.

Even if the remit remains unchanged until its following review in 2026, the central bank must urgently make efforts to reduce forecast errors. For instance, since 2016 when the inflation target regime began, RBI’s inflation readings saw both overestimation and underestimation, while GDP growth projections saw persistent overestimation. Accuracy in economic forecasts is central to any inflation-targeting regime, as monetary policy decisions are based entirely on internal projections. Another aspect that has vexed public opinion relates to the adverse impact of supply shocks, even though it lies outside the realm of monetary policy. In India, the prominence of food and fuel in the consumption basket amplifies the dominance of supply-side shocks, and perhaps it’s only reasonable to hold the government accountable for food and fuel price fluctuations.

Though executed by RBI, monetary policy is essentially a contract between the sovereign—via the central bank—and the people. As Patra noted, it’s an assurance by the sovereign to citizens about the money they can trust, that doesn’t lose purchasing power and stores future value. Put another way, price stability is a shared responsibility between the government and the central bank, and the sovereign is equally answerable.

2022-10-31 10:40:19.726553,We Got This Covered,Which movie monster could you take in a fistfight?,"You wake up in a cold sweat, but the nightmare isn’t over. You’re trapped in a horror movie, and the only way out is through the monster. All you have for weapons are your fists.

Here at We Got This Covered, there are some badass writers who can do more than angrily type on their keyboards. Depending on the monster, we think we might actually have a legitimate shot at getting out of these movies alive. That leads to the real question: Which movie monster could we take in a fistfight? Here’s what some of the WGTC staff had to say on the subject.

Tristyn Akbas vs. Chucky (Child’s Play)

When you think of monsters you could easily take in a fight, Chucky easily comes to mind. The little doll from Child’s Play, the 1988 film which was directed by Tom Holland, was possessed by the soul of a serial killer, Charles Lee Ray as played by Brad Dourif. Again, Chucky is a doll, he would come up to your knee at best.

The only reason you might not be able to take him in a fistfight is that he’s too low to punch, so you would kick the little demon into oblivion. Even he knows his capabilities, resorting to stalking a child rather than going after an adult. Put any half-witted adult in front of him, and he would not last more than two minutes. He would end up looking like one of Sid’s toys from Toy Story.

—Tristyn Akbas

Christian Bone vs. Aliens (Signs)

For the majority of the runtime, the aliens from M. Night Shyamalan’s alien invasion flick, Signs, would appear to be formidable opponents, what with the way they are kept in the shadows and talked up as vastly more intelligent and advanced than our own race. But the twist ending, one of Shyamalan’s most notorious, reveals just how easy one would be to take in a fight. Spoilers incoming…they’re fatally allergic to water. All you’d need to face one is a Super Soaker and you’d be laughing, like M. Night on his way to the bank after hoodwinking us into seeing another of his movies.

—Christian Bone

Misty Contreras vs. Abner Devereaux (Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park)

Abner Devereaux was the sorest of sore sports in KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park. I mean, seriously, what was his beef against KISS anyway? When you think about it, a band with a name that big would have brought some serious revenue to the park. Where’s your team spirit, Devereaux? Thanks to lil’ Abner, we got to see the band fight against animatronic versions of themselves, that’s pretty cool. But that was just rude when he kidnapped Melissa’s boyfriend Sam and made him his bitch. And Devereaux was defeated in the end, but I would’ve ripped that resister out of Sam’s neck and installed it in Devereaux’s and made him clean out my pantry.

—Misty Contreras

Jonathon Greenall vs. Audrey II (Little Shop Of Horrors)

Sure the Mean Green Mother From Outer Space sings a big game, but when it comes down to a one-on-one fight, they’re at a massive disadvantage. Sure, they have lots of strong tendrils, but the lack of legs and their big heads means they can’t easily defend themselves, so I’ve just got to run in swinging. Eventually, I’ll land a hit.

Plus, I’m an apartment-dwelling millennial, so I naturally kill any houseplant I interact with anyway, and what is Audrey II but a huge chance to show why I shouldn’t be allowed to have indoor plants?

Furthermore, in the movie, Audrey II lost to Rick Moranis, the patron saint of dorky white people, meaning the historical precedent is in my favor.

—Jonathon Greenall

Taylor Mansfield vs. Ghostface (Scream)

While supernatural entities in horror are more difficult choices to physically take on in a brawl, there are other figures in the spooky genre that are much easier to engage in battle—and that would be the infamous Ghostface killer from the long-standing Scream franchise. So, when the decision presented itself to choose a killer that would be easy to take on in a fight, the Ghostface persona seemed like a reasonable selection.

Although Ghostface might appear to be an unstoppable force, the killers who don the iconic black and white mask are actually weak. In the franchise’s films, the killers relied on sneaking up behind their victims to attack them, rather than fighting them one-on-one, which just proves that even they knew they couldn’t win in a fight. Other than a sneaky approach, the Ghostface killers are weak bullies that can easily get smoked. I mean, come on, an old lady even used the Ghostface identity, which really tells you all you need to know.

—Taylor Mansfield

Cody Raschella vs. Lotso (Toy Story 3)

Okay, hear me out. A life-sized Lotso would be terrifying. Think of him as practically the fuzzy version of Kingpin. Imagine how much he can bench press? One flick of that oversized paw and bam! you’re tossed across the room and sliding down the wall. If you were trapped in Sunnyside Daycare as Woody and the rest of Andy’s toys were in Toy Story 3 and suddenly realized you were hostage to a lifesize scowling pink teddy bear hellbent on tossing you in the can and munching you into recycled bits, you’d be scared too, don’t lie. That being said, here’s why we think you’d still be able to take him in a fistfight.

Okay, the first thing you do is reduce him to tears. No, seriously, once you mention his previous owner Daisy—you know, the one who abandoned him—he’s done for. Then, you employ Slink to wrap his coils around Lotso’s legs and ka-pow! he’s tumbling to the ground. Here’s where you go in for the kill. Not that you need backup, but if Buzz is around, call him over to pin Lotso’s arms down. Now you have uninterrupted access to deliver as many blows as it takes to defeat him.

There, you’re welcome.

—Cody Raschella

Charlotte Simmons vs. Tethered Charlotte (Us)

What makes my Tethered counterpart from Jordan Peele’s Us the ideal opponent is that I wouldn’t have to think very much about it. By all accounts, this is as fair a matchup as it could possibly get. All I would have to do is be a bit better on the day. The Wilsons were largely overpowered due to their initial lack of the killer instinct present in their counterparts, a mistake that I can now avoid should I ever need to prepare for such a fight.

Moreover, if we understand the Tethered as the deepest, most twisted versions of ourselves, then I can picture my counterpart being forever glued to a Disney Plus queue populated by nothing but Zootopia, the original release of which coincided around the time I fell in love with movies as a whole. Indeed, as they’d absorb their Nth viewing of Judy Hopps’ plight, they would never see me coming.

—Charlotte Simmons

Francisca Tinoco vs. Jean Jacket (NOPE)

Here’s the thing, in order to beat Jean Jacket, actually engaging in physical violence with it would be an instant recipe for getting your butt kicked all the way to next year’s Halloween. Granted, I’m not the bravest soldier when it comes to enduring scary horror movie monsters. Most of the time, I try to stay away from them, by not tuning in to, most likely, a single other movie on this list. However, I can’t resist a good Jordan Peele, and in NOPE, Peele presents a man-eating alien that at least gives me a fair chance at survival. All I have to do is avoid eye contact (which being a woman on planet Earth has given me plenty of practice in), and figure out a way to make something incredibly deadly look tasty enough to eat. That’s basically a McDonald’s meal, so how hard can it be? I think I would be OK.

—Francisca Tinoco

Matt Tuck vs. Old Man Michael Myers (Halloween 2018)

He’s the face of slasher films everywhere, and his haunting theme music is a horror and Halloween staple.

Michael Myers is arguably the most famous movie monster of the past 50 years, and the latest Blumhouse films have established him with a new generation of fans (well, maybe not Halloween Ends…).

Going back to the first of the latest trilogy, Michael had been locked in a psychiatric hospital since the events of the original 1978 flick. Supposedly, he was 21 years old then. That makes him 61 when the 2018 reboot/continuation kicks off. In the time between the ’78 classic and ’18 restart, he’s been confined to an extremely limited space to move, as we saw at the beginning of the movie when Michael’s modified William Shatner mask is flaunted before him. It triggers his unexplained superpowers and goes on yet another killing spree (because slashers gotta slash, I guess).

Removing all the superpowers, after 40 years of confinement in a small space with limited to no exercise, his muscles would have atrophied. Given his size, just moving that large frame would be fairly exhausting for someone with almost no muscle mass, I would imagine. That makes Michael virtually defenseless.

—Matt Tuck

Chynna Wilkinson vs. John Kramer (Saw)

Saw aficionados—and horror fanatics alike—are familiar with the infamous Jigsaw killer, John Kramer. There are three individuals who are synonymous with the Jigsaw moniker: John Kramer, Amanda Young, and Mark Hoffman, but the former is responsible for conceiving the “live or die” mentality that underlies Jigsaw’s modus operandi. When it was asked of us, the WGTC staff, to choose a movie monster that we could take in a fist fight, it didn’t take long before John Kramer sprang to mind. It can be argued that his method in the madness is far more imposing than the man himself. If we ever met in a parking lot somewhere, it wouldn’t take more than a few right hooks to render him unconscious; Tobin Bell is 80 years old, and Kramer isn’t far behind. Plus, the dude has cancer. Come on.

—Chynna Wilkinson

Staci White vs. Jennifer Check (Jennifer’s Body)

Could I take Jennifer Check in a fistfight post-becoming a succubus? No, probably not. Once she becomes a man-eating monster with a dislocating jaw, the odds would be against me. Needy could hardly beat her, and she had way more motivation than I do. But I think I could take her before the transformation, though honestly, I would just prefer that we run away together instead.

2022-10-31 10:40:19.728326,Autostraddle,How it Ends,"I begin to realize my relationship is over when my boyfriend starts cleaning his gun in our apartment. It’s his apartment, really. He owns it, if you can call taking out a huge mortgage with zero down “owning it” at all. I pay him rent. I helped pick out the sofa. He knows I hate guns, that they scare me. He sets out a TV tray and lays down a cloth and some tools, and he gets to work.

He’s started talking a lot about how he wishes he could’ve enlisted, if health problems hadn’t kept him away. He plugs in the surround sound and we watch Saving Private Ryan, me balled up on a corner of the sofa, hands covering my ears as the bullets fly from the speakers behind us. Sometimes, he lies on the floor of our bedroom and tries to imagine his future, and I can just see the clouds gathering on the horizon.

“Maybe I’ll redecorate the bathroom in wrought iron,” he says one day from the floor.

We decorated that bathroom together, I remind him. Don’t you like it? He nods, from very far away.

We met my senior year of high school. I’d turned 18 a few months before. He was 26. Feeling in love, valid, chosen for the first time and ready to escape my parents’ home, I made my life his. Three years later, we’re living together in his hometown, hanging out with his friends. I work full time and attend community college some nights. We get a dog. My boyfriend rips me DVDs of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and I watch Angel, Buffy’s 270 year-old boyfriend, leave during her senior year of high school. I watch her fend off the end of the world as her own world is ending and think:

I can’t imagine. I don’t want to imagine. I can never lose him.

And then, of course, I do. Sitting together on that sofa we picked out, I weep as he tells me words that don’t matter, as he gets up to leave. Numbly, I open my phone and text some friends to come help me pack up my things. He is 29. I am three days shy of my 21st birthday.

Sometimes now, decades later, with that old boyfriend nearly forgotten, when I feel too much of life, or when I can’t feel it at all, I put on a scary movie, turn on the good speakers, and let it tear its way through me. In all my favorites, someone’s world is ending, far more dramatically than mine ever has. Some nights, I watch the Tethered come for Adelaide in Us. On long, hot smoky days in August, I turn on Midsommar, watching Dani’s face as she struggles, moment by moment, to choke down the raw carcass of her grief. When I want a family who stays together with all they’ve got, I turn on A Quiet Place. When I’m ready for a screaming gash of red desert and Charlize Theron’s desperate determination, I put on Fury Road.

I just love a good apocalypse.

***

When I first sit down to write about these movies, about the stories I return to again and again, I write about all the wrong things. I write about the times I can’t get off the sofa. I write about the suffocation of Red Flag weather in August. I write about desiccation, about the way things sour with entropy and drought.

But these stories aren’t stagnant. In fact, they’re not about endings at all.

At the beginning of 10 Cloverfield Lane, we watch a woman hurriedly pack her suitcase. She’s stressed, fumbling. As she dashes out the door, she pauses to drop her engagement ring onto the dresser. Soon she’ll be on the Interstate, distracted by texts and voicemails from the man she left behind, and a collision with a pick-up truck will send her spinning. She’ll awaken chained to the wall in a half-painted cinderblock room, and that’s where her story really starts.

This past August, I caught Covid. First time. Recovery is still rough. Nearly two months after my first positive test, there are days when I’m not so much tired as empty, when every interaction feels like sleepwalking. I spend my bad days moving between my bed, my sofa and my desk, willing myself to work, to eat, to load the dishwasher. Some days, when I sit down to write, every thought requires a sort of surfacing from deep water, like sending messages to a submarine. Words are needed. Do you copy? Over.

It’s on one of those days, when I’m willing myself out of bed to feed my dog Milo or answer an email or get a drink of water, that I realize what it is that keeps me queueing up these movies. They’re not really apocalypse stories at all. They’re stories of change. Of new beginnings. Because the people in them just keep going.

When she wakes up in that cell, Michelle immediately starts moving, knocking over her makeshift IV pole to fish for the cracked cell phone sitting just out of reach. When Adelaide first sees the Tethered in her driveway in Us, she draws her son to her, tells her daughter to put on her shoes. In A Quiet Place, a year after losing her youngest child to alien invaders, Evelyn labors silently in a bathtub, ready to risk everything, all over again. In Fury Road, with a family of warlords hot on her trail, Furiosa keeps her foot on the gas, moving herself and her charges forward at all costs. Faced with the unspeakable, these women have a choice to make: give up, or keep moving. And somehow they do it. They get back up, and they keep stumbling forward.

Maybe it’s not a choice at all.

***

When I’m turning 21 and the man at the center of my universe implodes it, I weep for a week on a friend’s sofa. Then I get a second job and start making plans to move to the city I dreamed about before I met him. I’m angry, but I don’t yet have the right words, the right perspective, for my anger. I don’t yet have words for you were too old. I was too young. This wasn’t right. But I keep moving forward. I have to.

After that break up, there will be so many times in my life when I just have to keep going. The horrible, numb decade I spend in the closet, a decade where I can’t see past the enormity of my own isolation. Other break-ups, other months when I can’t get off the sofa. The year my dog Cyrus is dying, and I care for him around the clock. Those first pandemic years, when I think I might never share space with my loved ones again. There will always be hardships and endings and changes.

Sitting on that sofa we picked out together, watching the DVDs my boyfriend made me, decades before I would first see any of my favorite scary movies, this was the real lesson Buffy tried to teach me. It wasn’t about Angel at all. It would just be years before I could fully understand it.

The apocalypse will come, and it will come again. The world will change. You’ll take a beat.

And you’ll keep going.","I begin to realize my relationship is over when my boyfriend starts cleaning his gun in our apartment.

2022-10-31 11:40:19.730094,WinterIsComing.net,Review: Interview With The Vampire Episode 5 goes too far,"Well, Interview with the Vampire episode 5 sure was a doozy, and is bound to be an incredibly polarizing episode for several reasons.

Major SPOILERS ahead for Interview with the Vampire episode 5

Interview with the Vampire Episode 5, “A Vile Hunger for Your Hammering Heart,” ends with one of the most graphic and brutal scenes of violence in the entire series up until this point as Lestat reaches his breaking point and viciously attacks Louis.

Lestat is evil. He’s a murderer. He’s never been a good guy and has been abusive, albeit not physically, since Episode 1. However, this series has also been heavily marketed as an epic queer gothic romance story, so the sudden prolonged scene of domestic violence did feel rather sudden, especially because there was no warning of any kind that it was coming at the start of the episode. Even the depiction of vampire murders and torture hasn’t been as graphic as the scene at the end of this episode. And no, it doesn’t happen in the books.

It’s not so much that the show decided to include domestic violence but how it was included. Everything is shown on-screen, and it’s hard to understand why the writers felt the audience needed to see Louis beaten so viciously. In a series that has been pretty adept at handling racial politics thus far, having a white man brutalize his Black partner on-screen is…a choice.

The entire incident is shown through Claudia’s perspective, so it’s possible the series could retcon this by claiming Claudia misrepresented what happened, but I think that would make it even worse because then it would seem like the entire sequence was added purely for shock value.

I believe the scene’s purpose was to showcase just how horrifying the true nature of Lestat and Louis’ relationship is. Now that viewers have seen that; there’s no real justification for “stanning” a character like Lestat. Interview with the Vampire has toyed with audience expectations since the start, usually through the lens of Daniel Molloy interviewing Louis in Dubai.

Molloy has previously pointed out that Louis is a victim of abuse, but Louis refuses to see it that way; likely as a response to his trauma, he’s romanticizing his past so he doesn’t have to accept the reality of what happened to him. So I can see how the scene in question might have a point.

If Louis were telling this story, we probably would not have seen it play out so viciously, but because Mollow is reading about it in Claudia’s diary, it makes sense that we see the unvarnished version of events.

Claudia leaves home

Apart from that scene, there was another plot point in this episode that I’m not thrilled with. Episode 5 picks up after Claudia’s attempted suicide. She’s been running amok all over town, killing people willy-nilly and throwing bodies into the river without much care. Louis and Lestat are understandably pissed about this because she’s left a trail of bodies behind her and it’s drawing suspicion.

Eventually the bodies are discovered in the river and the cops start sniffing around Louis and Lestat since at least one of the victims lived just a few doors down. Claudia’s room is full of “souvenirs,” including some severed fingers and toes. She’s a stone-cold killer with a vicious streak a mile wide.

When Claudia’s vampire parents try to get her to reign it in, she lashes out. Frustrations over being stuck in a teenage body and her grief over Charlie’s death come to a head. Claudia admits that most of the people she’s killed have involved her desire to turn someone else into a vampire so she can have an immortal companion, similar to what Lestat and Louis have with each other.

Claudia decides to leave home and go out on her own to find other vampires, although Lestat warns that they won’t be kind to her. Claudia learns that the hard way when she meets a vampire named Bruce on a college campus, and he sexually assaults her. Thankfully, the actual assault is not shown onscreen. That’s because Louis rips the pages out of Claudia’s notebook, but more on that in a minute.

I’m tired of writers using rape and sexual assault as a plot device to force female characters to mature or “grow up.” It’s cheap and lazy writing. Claudia gets assaulted and suddenly becomes a much more mature version of herself. Seriously? In the “Inside the Episode” featurette, one of the show’s executive producers says that Claudia’s experience with Bruce “toughened her up.” Again I say, seriously? That whole part of the episode just felt very unnecessary. Using rape to rush character development for female characters is reductive and insulting.

In the present, Molloy and Louis disagree about the pages containing Claudia’s assault. Louis is protective over her and doesn’t want that information to be shared with the world. I wish the writers had shown as much care for Claudia’s story in this episode as Louis does. Molloy points out that Louis is editorializing again, and when he does that, it makes it hard for him to trust everything else he’s been saying.

Taking a page from Lestat’s playbook, Louis uses his vampire abilities to trigger an attack of Parkinson’s in Molloy’s hand. In return, Molloy slaps the vampire, and they move on from the disagreement. For now, Molloy drops it.

The conversation regarding these missing pages is interesting because Molloy points out that when the story is released, it won’t belong to Louis anymore. It becomes something else. He makes a snarky comment about how people might make sexy Claudia costumes. I thought it was timely, given that we’re probably about to see a lot of tasteless Jeffrey Dahmer costumes this Halloween, thanks to Netflix.

Once Molloy and Louis get past the missing-pages argument, Louis urges Molloy to keep reading.

A breaking point

After returning home from her trip, Claudia witnesses an emotional meeting between Louis and his sister Grace in a cemetery. It’s now the 1930s, some seven years and change since Claudia first left, and the Great Depression has started. Grace and her husband have lost everything and are moving north.

Grace wants to say goodbye to Louis for good. Not only is she moving away, but she shows Louis that she’s had his name added to the stone marker beneath their mother’s. Even though “Louis” is still alive, Grace can no longer see him as her brother and tells him it will be easier for her to think of him as dead. It’s really heartbreaking seeing Louis lose his very last tether to his human life. In the years since Claudia has gone missing, Louis has become seriously depressed.

Since Claudia was basically a “bandaid baby” for him and Lestat, their relationship has fallen into disrepair. They constantly snark at each other, and Lestat has started seeing Antoinette with increasing frequency.

When Claudia sees Louis break down in tears at the gravesite after Grace leaves, she realizes that he needs her and finally comes home. But she doesn’t plan on staying. Claudia invites Louis to go with her as she travels to places like Romania and Europe to meet other vampires.

Well, that suggestion does not go over well with Lestat, who is very possessive of Louis. And when he realizes that Louis is considering leaving with Claudia, he loses his mind, hence the long, violent altercation that ends with Lestat taking Louis on his first flight into the skies (Lestat can fly). There he tries to make Louis admit that he never loved him and then drops him from thousands of feet in the air.

Obviously we know Louis doesn’t die, but that doesn’t make seeing him land with a sickening crunch any easier for viewers or Claudia to watch. That’s where this episode ends, and we have another week to try and process…all of that.

2022-10-31 11:40:19.731824,Decrypt,Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin: Crypto Industry Shouldn't Be 'Enthusiastically Pursuing Institutional Capital',"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin weighed in Sunday on the regulatory debate surrounding crypto, providing his thoughts on what industry rules should—and should not—include.

Regulation could make crypto more palatable to mainstream financial institutions and legitimize cryptocurrencies as an asset class. But new rules and policies could also alter the industry’s DNA, particularly as it relates to principles like censorship resistance and decentralization.

Buterin said he believes preserving the latter should be the priority.

“I don't think we should be enthusiastically pursuing large institutional capital at full speed,” he said. “Regulation that leaves the crypto space free to act internally but makes it harder for crypto projects to reach the mainstream is much less bad than regulation that intrudes on how crypto works internally.”

Basically, especially at this time, regulation that leaves the crypto space free to act internally but makes it harder for crypto projects to reach the mainstream is much less bad than regulation that intrudes on how crypto works internally. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 30, 2022

Buterin’s Twitter thread comes ten days after a controversial blog post by Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and chief executive of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, in which he outlined his regulatory vision for the industry.

Bankman-Fried subsequently capitulated to Crypto Twitter after receiving pushback on potential rules related to DeFi, such as requiring autonomous programs to comply with U.S. sanctions and making crypto websites register as a broker-dealer. He revised the post and said he will continue to do so.

Regulatory uncertainty is seen as a barrier to institutional crypto investing, according to a new Fidelity Investments survey. The Institutional Investor Digital Assets Study found that out of more than 1,000 institutional investors, 16% said a lack of clarity around regulation was an obstacle to investing in digital assets.

On the other hand, more than 8 in 10 (81%) of the institutional investors surveyed view digital assets as having a role in investment portfolios. In addition, 43% of institutional investors said they would be interested in a Bitcoin ETF.

Segments of the crypto industry have been pursuing institutional capital for almost a decade, ever since the Winklevoss twins’ initial filing for a Bitcoin ETF-like trust in 2013. While futures-based products trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Securities and Exchange Commission has dragged its feet on approving a spot-based Bitcoin ETF.

That’s not a bad thing, according to Buterin.

“I'm actually kinda happy a lot of the ETFs are getting delayed,” he said. “The ecosystem needs time to mature before we get even more attention.”

Another maybe-controversial take of mine is that I don't think we should be enthusiastically pursuing large institutional capital at full speed. I'm actually kinda happy a lot of the ETFs are getting delayed. The ecosystem needs time to mature before we get even more attention. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 30, 2022

Buterin divided the policy goals he envisions for the crypto industry into two categories: providing better protection to consumers who navigate the nascent industry, and stemming the illicit flow of cryptocurrency—which he said are not exclusive to the DeFi space.

To address the latter, Buterin is skeptical of requiring DeFi protocol front-ends to abide by Know Your Customer (KYC) standards. While such standards are used by financial institutions to prevent money laundering, fraud, and corruption, “hackers write custom code to interact with contracts,” circumventing the usual KYC barriers.

“It would annoy users but do nothing against hackers,” he said.

The ""KYC on defi frontends"" idea does not seem very pointful to me: it would annoy users but do nothing against hackers. Hackers write custom code to interact with contracts already. Exchanges are clearly a much more sensible place to do the KYC, and that's happening already. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 30, 2022

There are DeFi regulations that Buterin thinks could be more helpful, such as limits on the amount of leverage a user can trade with, transparency in code audits, and requiring “knowledge-based tests” as opposed to “plutocratic net-worth minimum rules.”

Buterin said he’s also in favor of crafting regulation in a way that allows for the further use of zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic principle that preserves privacy.

The response to the response

SBF responded to Buterin’s points, stating he thinks they “are pretty reasonable” and expressed an openness to bringing the ethereum co-founder to Washington DC in order to give nuanced input on regulation.

“I think that policymakers/regulators would find it pretty interesting to hear from @VitalikButerin,” SBF stated. “he's very different from the average person in DC, but in a kinda refreshing way—calmly and thoughtfully saying what he thinks.”

Buterin’s comments also appeared to receive an endorsement from Changpeng Zhao, founder and chief executive of Binance, another leading cryptocurrency exchange. The CEO responded to the thread with a thumbs up emoji.

👍 — CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) October 30, 2022

Crypto investor Ryan Sean Adams gave a nod to Buterin’s entry into the debate as well, stating Buterin is welcome to share his thoughts at Bankless, a DAO and crypto media project.

Adams had delivered pointed criticism to SBF’s initial blog post, tweeting, “This absolutely sucks.”

2022-10-31 05:40:19.742960,The Alpena News,"Halloween, elections earlier, bigger, scarier","Last year at this time, my Commentary page cartoon for this paper pointed out the cultural chasm that has opened up between the Halloween of the 1970s and that of today.

This year, I drew a picture of the top-selling costumes of 2022, which include the central figure in the smash-hit Netflix series Stranger Things, the hideous — really hideous — demogorgon. In the 1970s, it was impossible to even imagine such a costume. At that time, we dressed as things like witches, ghosts, football players, cowboys, indians, bums/hobos, and ethnic stereotypes.

Having expressed my opinion on the subject in pictures, today, on Oct. 31 itself, I will expand on the topic in words.

How is Halloween different now?

Let us count the ways:

HALLOWEEN STARTS EARLIER

When curmudgeon-me was a tyke, the Halloween spirit — also known as Candy Lust — kicked in a couple of weeks before the big night. Now, it seems like the first signs of Halloween — store displays, pumpkin-flavored products — start appearing just after Labor Day.

Before long, the big-box stores will be advertising combination Back to School/Halloween sales. One day, Halloween could be like Carnival in Rio, or Boxing Day in the Bahamas, where people spend the entire year preparing their costumes and planning parties.

HALLOWEEN IS BIGGER

Dressing up was mainly an activity for kids, back when I was one of those. Today, it’s a toss-up which class of citizens dresses up more: children, adults or pets.

The statistics on the size of the Halloween economy boggle the brain. According to a report last week on the website Stacker, Americans were projected to spend $10.6 billion on the holiday this year. An estimated $490 million of that is for dressing up their dogs and cats.

Many common costume choices of yore have gone by the boards, for reasons that stoke our culture wars. I began this essay listing some familiar getups from long ago, which ended with several that are off limits now: “indian,” “bum/hobo,” and “ethnic stereotype.”

In 2022, one does not mimic a Native American, nor a person experiencing homelessness, nor does one appropriate other people’s cultures. In 1971, I dressed as a little Dutch boy, wearing my immigrant grandfather’s traditional garb from his home in Holland, and won first place in the foreign category at a community party. Second and third went to kids wearing stereotyped Mexican and Chinese getups, looking like a miniature Pancho Villa and Hop Sing. In case you’ve been away awhile, costumes like that are no longer appropriate options.

As for grownups, just set Google to “images” and search “Halloween costumes for women/men 2022.” You will find that couture for women is far sexier in this day and age than when “Our Bodies, Ourselves” came out. Many professions are adapted to the “sexy” genre, such as sexy cowgirl, nurse, pirate, maid, waitress, witch, certified public accountant, you name it. Men, as you might expect, show very little imagination when it comes to dressing up, but they are capable of ponying up $250 to look just like Captain Jack Sparrow.

HALLOWEEN IS SCARIER

Remember bedsheets stuffed to look like ghosts with heads hanging from trees, and leering, glowing jack-o’-lanterns? Spooky!

Half a century later, truly horrific decorations have become the norm.

For instance, at one of the restaurants along the strip in downtown Harrisville (I won’t say which), the decor exemplifies the horrors of the season. It includes:

∫ six severed heads dangling from the ceiling

∫ an assortment of five severed hands and feet, all hanging from hooks, except one tethered to a bloody cleaver

∫ two life-size torsos of demons with gaping, fang-filled maws

∫ 18 realistic skulls (plus a clever mobile of 13 little realistic skulls)

∫ one set of blue conjoined twin devil-babies sitting in a high chair.

There are other horrors, like a kind of farmer-ghoul in overalls with his green head twisted around like Linda Blair’s show-stealing scene in “The Exorcist.”

Families dine there in booths ringed by statues of the denizens of Satan, apparently without losing their appetites. I wonder if the kids lose any sleep … When I was their age, my horrors came from seeing the Vietnam War on the 6 o’ clock news. I know I lost sleep. Then again, those horrors weren’t make-believe.

After ruminating on Halloween, it occurred to me that the changes I discerned are comparable to what has happened to elections in the same time period.

ELECTIONS START EARLIER

In 1972, for the fiercely contested Democratic Party, the presidential election campaign began with the New Hampshire primaries in January, while incumbent Richard Nixon had the Republican nomination sewn up.

The campaign received so little attention that very few people noticed Watergate, which broke as an utterly ignored news story in June, and was not a factor in the landslide outcome of the contest. June was about the time “Nixon Now” stickers started appearing on car bumpers. Yard signs weren’t much of a thing, then.

The relative lack of interest is because, when there were three TV networks, which all ran a half-hour news program simultaneously at 6 p.m., when residential roofs sprouted antennae, and viewers had to toggle with something called “rabbit ears” to get Cronkite out of a blizzard of screen snow, it was technically impossible for politics to consume the culture.

Now, politicians wallpaper the airwaves of several powerhouse networks on something called “cable.” Commentary on the next election never ceases on those stations. And attack campaign advertisements dominate the entire TV dial and online as the big day nears. Vicious in the extreme, they make Nixon’s ads look quaint. In the 1970s, candidates for Congress and for state and local seats rarely ran ads. Today, people slap bumper stickers on their cars and stick signs in their yards long before Election Day, and a sizable minority never remove them.

ELECTIONS ARE BIGGER

Again, the statistics tell the story of a boom in the election hype economy.

In the 1960s, a relative pittance went into campaign financing. But because of the notorious Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission decision in 2010, when the Supreme Court ruled that money equals free speech, billions of untraceable dollars now legally pay for the nonstop advertising on TV and online, among many other expenditures.

ELECTIONS ARE SCARIER

People on both sides of our political canyon view a victory by the other side as a potential national disaster.

The stakes are incredibly high, much higher than in the past, when there was a general consensus in support of the electoral system, the right to an abortion had finally been affirmed as constitutional, and the planet wasn’t on fire.

Now, half the country has called into question the integrity and reliability of the way we decide elections nonviolently, Roe v. Wade has been overturned, and the United Nations reports that only 26 of 183 nations are reducing greenhouse gas emissions, sending Earth into a climate sauna.

Now that’s scary!

There are some differences between Halloween and Elections.

Today, Halloween is safer, with fewer kids walking in traffic and virtually no sociopaths handing out treats with needles in them, while elections are becoming riskier for poll workers and voters alike.

Halloween is less flammable, with Devil’s Night arson thankfully a thing of the past. Unfortunately, the political atmosphere has become incendiary.

While the kids are going house to house demanding treats, there are fewer of the extortionary tricks being played, so neighborhoods are not as littered, in the form of TP’d trees and smashed pumpkins, on the morning of All Saints Day. Meanwhile, during campaign season, the landscape is littered with yard signs and billboards for weeks before and after the election.

In any event, Happy Halloween, and please remember that, in this democratic republic, it is your duty, not your privilege, to vote a week from tomorrow. Unless you’re on the other side, then stay home!","Now, it seems like the first signs of Halloween — store displays, pumpkin-flavored products — start appearing just after Labor Day.

2022-10-30 12:40:19.754234,Online Tech Tips,How to Connect Bluetooth Headphones to Your PS5 (With and Without an Adapter),"Soundbars are fine, but if you want to be immersed in your PlayStation 5 games, you’ll need some headphones. If you’re using a pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones, how can you connect them to Sony’s gaming console?

It might seem strange in a world where Bluetooth is in everything from toasters to cars, but connecting Bluetooth headphones to a PS5 is not a simple process.

Table of Contents

Does the PS5 Have Bluetooth?

While the PlayStation 5 does have Bluetooth, it only supports specific Bluetooth devices. You can connect a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse easily using the Bluetooth Accessories menu option in the console’s settings. If you try Bluetooth headphones, you won’t have much luck.

Is Sony just being obstinate here? There’s a good reason to avoid Bluetooth audio in a console, and you also won’t find native Bluetooth audio support on Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and S consoles. The Nintendo Switch has received a firmware update adding Bluetooth audio. However, when using it, you’ll quickly realize how unsuited Bluetooth can be for gaming.

Unless the headset and the device both support special low-latency Bluetooth protocols, you’re looking at latency over 200ms, which is easily noticeable to players. Nothing takes you out of a game like pulling the trigger and only hearing the shots after the muzzle flash! It’s a roll of the dice with specific headsets as well.

Using AirPods Max with a Switch yields decent results, but using a pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds offers an unusable experience. With each of the options we’ll cover below, we’ll discuss the latency considerations you’ll have to consider.

Official and Third-party PS5 Gaming Headsets

If you’re in the market for a new headset with your PS5, you should consider using one of the officially licensed headsets for the PS5. Sony sells several headphones that work with the PS5, with the Sony Pulse 3D being the entry-level model.

These devices don’t directly connect to the PS5. Instead, a USB wireless adapter plugs into a USB-A port on the front or rear of the console. Once the headset is turned on, it automatically binds with the adapter, and the PS5 should automatically switch over to the headphones.

The proprietary wireless signal used in these products is lag-free, at least to a human brain, so it offers a better experience than most Bluetooth headsets. Even better, you can use that same USB adapter with your PC or Mac, which is simply seen as a USB audio device.

Sony’s official solution offers great comfort, excellent 3D game audio, decent battery life, and an amazing price. There are certainly better headsets on the market, but the Pulse 3D is the best headset you’ll find at the $100 price point for a PS5, and Sony certainly knows how to make a headset that sounds good on any budget.

Using a Bluetooth Adapter

If you want to use a Bluetooth headset of your choice, then your best option is to use a third-party audio-only Bluetooth dongle listed as compatible with the PS5. These devices work the same way as the proprietary adapters mentioned above. They present as a USB audio device to the PS5 (or PC, Mac, etc.) and internally handle the wireless audio connection.

Unlike the proprietary adapters, you must manually pair the dongle with your headphones. This is usually done by first putting your headphones into pairing mode and then pressing the pairing button on the adapter. It should then automatically bind with the first Bluetooth audio device it detects that’s asking to pair.

These audio-only adapters can significantly reduce typical Bluetooth latency. By focusing only on audio and offering low-latency Bluetooth protocols such as aptX-LL, latency can go down to levels where you wouldn’t notice anything.

The catch is that you’ll have to use a headset that supports the same low-latency protocol as the adapter. Some adapters allow you to manually cycle through the protocols they support until you find one that offers the best sound quality and latency mix. These adapters also help reduce latency on PCs, Macs, and other devices that support USB audio.

There are many great Bluetooth adapters on sites like Amazon, but we like that the Avantree C81 is a tiny, low-latency Bluetooth transmitter that fits into the USB-C port on the front of your PS5. It offers sub-40ms latencies using the aptX-LL, and it will work with a Mac or PC, too, so you can easily move your headset between your PS5 and computer.

Plugging Into the DualSense Controller

Every PlayStation 5 Dualsense controller is also a wireless audio adapter using Sony’s proprietary technology. You’ll find a headphone jack on the controller between the two grips. Except for wireless buds such as Apple AirPods, most Bluetooth headsets offer a wired connection in addition to Bluetooth, with the necessary cable included in the package.

Simply plugging the headphones into the controller gives you the full benefit of wireless 3D audio with chat functionality, assuming your headset has a microphone. Although this isn’t a completely wireless solution, you’re only tethered to the controller and are otherwise free to sit wherever you like.

Apart from the minor inconvenience of a short wire running to the controller, the main drawback of this method is that it can reduce the battery life of your DualSense controller. The impact on battery life depends on volume levels and how power-hungry your particular headset is. Some Bluetooth headsets still let you use features such as noise cancellation or additional amplification. These features run off the headset’s battery and not the controller.

Connect To the TV’s Bluetooth Instead

If you have a recent smart TV model, there’s a good chance that it supports Bluetooth natively. This means you don’t have to connect your headset to the PS5. Instead, connect it to the TV, and any audio playing on the set will be audible.

The latency situation with TV Bluetooth audio varies wildly. Older or less expensive models tend to have high latency levels. If you already have a Bluetooth headset and a TV with Bluetooth audio support, there’s no harm in simply testing how well it works.

The exact method to connect your headphones to the TV varies by model and brand. It should be somewhere in the settings menu, but you’ll have to refer to your TV’s manual for the exact steps.

Connect to a TV Without Bluetooth (or Bad Bluetooth)

Older TVs most likely don’t have Bluetooth, or you might find that the Bluetooth might be too laggy or offers poor sound quality. If you’re okay with spending a small amount, you can solve this issue with an easy add-on solution.

Most TVs have an analog stereo output meant for headphones. Various adapters plug into this analog headphone output and provide low-latency Bluetooth audio.

Connecting your wireless headset to one of these add-on adapters is no different from connecting to any other Bluetooth audio device. Plug the box into the analog output of the TV, then put your wireless headphones into pairing mode. Following this, use the method described in the device’s manual to set the transmitter into pairing mode.

Whether you get good latency depends on which Bluetooth protocol is mutually supported by the transmitter and headset.

The Audikast will work with any television with audio output using optical, AUX, or RCA connections. Unfortunately, this does not support HDMI eARC, but it’s not a big deal considering that we only want stereo audio from the TV.

The Audikast supports aptX-LL, so you can have virtually no latency if your headset or earbuds support that protocol. Alternatively, if you have a FastStream headset, you can also take advantage of low latency.

Another cool feature of the Audikast is support for two headsets at once, so if you’re playing a couch co-op game, two people can use headphones without waking the neighbors.

General Troubleshooting Advice

Most of the solutions here are self-explanatory or require that you read the specific instructions included in the manual for the brand of device that you’re using, but you may find that you’re still not getting the sound from the PS5.

The solution is almost always found in the PS5’s audio settings. Go to Settings > Sound > Audio Output, then choose the correct output device. Usually, the PS5 will auto-switch to the USB Bluetooth adapter, but you can change things manually here if it doesn’t.

Another simple fix is to unplug the USB dongle and plug it back in or into a different USB port.","If you’re using a pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones, how can you connect them to Sony’s gaming console?

2022-10-31 11:40:19.765934,MakeUseOf,The Best Gadgets for the Adventure Tourist,"An underwater ROV is an excellent idea for adventure tourists that love to record the deep blue sea or want to explore pockets of the ocean for deep-sea fishing. One of the best is the FiFish V6. It enables the exploration of shipwrecks and coral reefs and the discovery of large schools of fish. At the same time, sailors can use them to inspect their boats for damage.

You can submerge this drone up to 328 feet, and it comes with a tether to match. It can get pretty dim down there, but this drone records the colors of the deep in a vibrant state, even in the absence of strong sunlight filtering through. This vividness is largely thanks to the f/2.5 aperture on the hyperlight-specific lens. A nighttime expedition is also an exciting activity in which you can partake. With the twin 2000-lumen headlights, exploring the eerie seabed and all its nooks and crannies is a memorable event all the family can enjoy.

The drone will provide you with memories in the form of high-quality videos in 4K at 30fps or full HD at 120fps and fine 12MP stills. This lens is also a 166-degree field-of-view lens, meaning that the camera can capture almost as much as is possible with the human eye. You can view what the lens sees and remotely control the underwater drone in FPV with the immersive VR headset, or you can use the app on your smartphone.

Another excellent feature is the AI Vision Lock, which focuses precisely on a target. It also has dependable image stabilization, which is very useful in strong currents, and live HD broadcasts to show off to your friends on social media.

It’s relatively easy to learn how to use it. There are two modes, one for beginners and another for more advanced users. In beginner mode, many advanced features, such as depth hold, which ensures you don’t go deeper than its 328-foot limit, are automatic. You can learn more features as you become more proficient, including extensive use of the ROV’s 360-degree movements.

However, the item’s dimensions may put off long-term adventure tourists. At 15 x 13 inches and weighing over 22 pounds, it might be too cumbersome for some to cart off to far-flung destinations.

A switch for adult stallions from tie-stall housing to free living in a large pasture improved their overall welfare, researchers found.

The change in management did not reduce the stallions’ docility toward familiar humans compared to their days in tie-stalls, the study team said.

Improvements in their welfare were seen only two weeks after the housing change, and were even more apparent in an assessment after three months, Silvana Popescu and her fellow researchers reported.

“Regardless of age, breed, physiological condition, or gender, all horses are social animals, requiring the company of their own kind,” the study team wrote in the journal Animals.

However, because of their natural instincts to fight each other, adult stallions are often kept in isolation.

The researchers noted that several studies have shown the possibility of free group housing for stallions and recommended methods to reduce the detrimental effects of limited social contact on their physical and/or mental wellbeing.

Nevertheless, the beneficial effect of transitioning from tie-stalls to free housing on adult stallions’ overall welfare has not been researched before.

In their study, the researchers monitored a group of 32 adult stallions during their transition from tie-stall housing with limited outdoor access to free group housing outdoors.

They examined changes in their overall welfare, perceived emotional status, and docility toward humans as a result of the change.

The study team made three visits to the Romanian farm – the first a couple of days before the management change, a second visit two weeks after the change, and then three months after.

Just two weeks after the management change, the studied stallions had significantly better welfare, which improved further over time as the group’s hierarchy stabilized.

“Additionally, their human-related responses improved, and their docility did not decrease, despite minimal human-animal contact during the study.”

The constant positive correlation between the animals’ docility score and their individual welfare quality scores in assessments under free housing, despite less frequent human-animal contact after the management change, is a promising result, they said.

It provides incentives to stallion owners who consider implementing similar management changes for their animals, they said.

“Given the findings in this paper and accounting for all precautions required while making such a management change, we conclude that adult stallions can and should be kept in free group housing to provide them with the best possible conditions to support their optimal welfare.”

All management decisions and changes observed in the study were planned and implemented solely by the owner of the animals.

The stallions, a mix of breeds, had been purchased gradually over the previous five years and housed in a progressively extended wooden barn, chain-tethered on two sides, with scheduled daily access to free movement in the six paddocks next to the barn. There was a two-metre gap between each paddock.

The tied-stall system limited social contact between the animals. It allowed a certain degree of visual contact, as well as smell and auditive contact, especially for stallions tethered next to each other or let out in neighboring paddocks at the same time. Generally, physical touch between them was not possible.

The management change involved the introduction of the stallions to a 15-hectare pasture of mixed terrain. The transition took place over several hours on a single day. Familiar handlers were present, equipped with long whips and ropes, ready to intervene in case of any fighting between the stallions.

At the request of the owner, none of the researchers was present at the release of the horses.

For the welfare assessments, the stallions’ five freedoms were explored through 25 mostly animal-based parameters, following mainly the protocol published in a 2019 study.

Without exception, the individual welfare quality scores for the stallions from the third assessment were higher than those recorded in the first assessment, even for those whose second assessment scores were lower or equal to the first one (when they were still in tie-stall housing).

The prevalence of stallions with an improper body condition score decreased after three months, as measured in the third assessment.

Most health problems were found to be more common in the tie-stalled environment, with many improving significantly in time after the transition to free group housing.

The authors said the large size of the pasture enabled escape possibilities for the animals from each other, which they described as a very important positive aspect.

“But, on the negative side, the lack of more diverse previous social contact triggered aggressive encounters, especially in the first few days after their release.” Group dynamics can change rapidly in this type of setting, they said.

There was an initial increase in the frequency of body lesions, and these remained significantly higher three months after the management change. Some more serious wounds were seen after two weeks – all produced by aggressive encounters between the stallions on the first days of free group housing – but none were seen during the assessment at three months.

The condition of more than half of the horses with swollen tendons/joints improved in only two weeks, and 82% of those with leg swellings at the first assessment, in tie-stall housing, were free of this problem after three months.

Respiratory problems also reduced in the group housing setup.

The study team said minimal previous acclimatization had been provided to the animals in the study before the housing transition. They said they would not encourage the transition method used by the owner to be reproduced, especially without continuous and close monitoring of the stallions.

“The owner’s choices and decisions nevertheless allowed us to observe the consequences of this type of transition.”

The study team, all in Romania, comprised Popescu, Cristin Borda and Anamaria Blaga Petrean, all with the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine in Cluj-Napoca; Eva Andrea Lazar, with the Association for the Welfare of Horses in Vatra Dornei; and Elena Mitrănescu, with the University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest.

2022-10-31 06:40:20.024799,HackerNoon,A Look at Some of the Latest Developments in Decentralized Finance in 2022,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) is when applications are deployed via blockchain networks to make financial assets available to the avergae person without the need for middlemen such as financial brokers. According to DefiLlama, the total TVL of the DeFi industry is currently over $55 billion. DeFi is often used to refer to a system that uses stringent software to link buyers, sellers, lenders, and borrowers with peers or an intermediary. The development of decentralized financial systems is still in its early stages.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is when applications are deployed via blockchain networks to make financial assets available to the avergae person without the need for middlemen such as financial brokers. In contrast to establishing an account with a bank or brokerage business, you do not need to submit personal details to get started with decentralized finance. Instead, DeFi is often used to refer to a system that uses stringent software to link buyers, sellers, lenders, and borrowers with peers or an intermediary. This contrasts with a company facilitating transactions or a fintech-focused app development firm.

The development of decentralized financial systems is still in its early stages. According to DefiLlama, the total TVL of the DeFi industry is currently over $55 billion. Although the overall amount of DeFi may seem large initially, it is vital to remember that the bulk of its coins lacks the liquidity or volume to be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. Furthermore, there are infrastructural issues, such as hackers and other weaknesses in DeFi systems. Scams abound in the fast-expanding world of distributed ledger technologies. DeFi's transaction span is without bounds for this kind of regulation.

Smart Contracts﻿

The DeFi legislation emphasizes digitally signed smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing programs that activate once predetermined conditions have been met, and these contracts power many applications in the DeFi space. For example, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) use a combination of smart contracts and automated market makers (AMMs) to enable users to swap tokens almost instantly. Instead of relying on an order book with orders from other traders, smart contracts enable swapping tokens from a user's wallet and the liquidity pools that store the tokens in the DEX.

Minting Mechanism﻿

Another example is the minting mechanism seen with NFTs. Once the smart contract receives a certain amount of tokens, it deposits the NFT into the sender's wallet. For example, if it costs 0.5 ETH to mint an NFT and there's a maximum minting limit of 3, the smart contract will deposit 3 NFTs to the wallet that sends 1.5 ETH, 2 NFTs if 1 ETH is sent and 1 NFT is 0.5 ETH sent from that wallet. Smart contracts remove the need for a middleman to manage the interactions between users and protocols within the blockchain space.

Stablecoins are a popular DeFi staple

The industry of stablecoins is another area where decentralized finance is rapidly expanding. Stablecoins provide a safer and less volatile alternative for investors who want to earn money via DeFi. Tether (USDT is currently the most popular stablecoin, followed by USD Coin (USDC). These cryptocurrencies are pegged to the US dollar, with their values staying within the $1 range with very slight fluctuations. This is in contrast to regular cryptocurrencies whose values can change drastically over time. The relative stability of stablecoins makes them an attractive investment vehicle, especially during bear markets, with investors able to stake these coins for a fixed percentage return.

Conclusion

Because of advancements in blockchain security, we will continue to see new developments, protocols, and advancements over the years. Furthermore, DeFi increases its market position by expanding the size of its blockchain community. Considering the continued growth of DeFi, the next few years will prove more significant for the emerging sector.","The development of decentralized financial systems is still in its early stages.

A man rescued from the water near Haumoana on Sunday evening was taken to Hawke's Bay Hospital in a critical condition and later transferred to hospital in Christchurch.

A police spokesperson said a man was reported in difficulty in the water off Haumoana Beach about 8pm. The man had reportedly become paralysed while surfcasting alone and may have been floating in the water for more than 30 minutes before being discovered in the waves by a woman who also found a dog tethered to a fishing rod in the sand.

She informed an off-duty police officer living in the area and the man was heard calling for help as the officer approached.

A Te Whatu Ora spokeswoman said a man in his 40s was later transferred from Hawke's Bay to Christchurch. No further condition details were available.","A person was rescued and taken to hospital in a critical condition after difficulties in the water at Haumoana Beach on Sunday evening.

As October is coming to a close, a lot of cryptocurrencies have started seeing a noticeable price increase. Combine that with some exciting new opportunities, and there are plenty of coins with great potential to consider for investment in these final days of the month.

ETH

Ethereum is easily the second-most important project that was ever created in the crypto industry — the one that transformed it from a world of digital currency to a world of smart contracts, dApps, DeFi, metaverse, and all other products that people around the world use today. In the last week, the ETH price has surged by 23.27%, and in the last 24 hours alone, ETH has gone up by nearly 6%. Right now, its price is struggling, which started after it reached the height of $1630. After briefly breaching this level and reaching the height of $1,644, the token corrected to $1,618, which is where it sits at the time of writing.

Ethereum recently completed the Merge, which finally moved it to PoS, which is something that the community has been anticipating for years now. But, due to the bear market, its price has not experienced the hype or the proper growth that was expected to follow.

D2T

D2T is a native cryptocurrency of a platform called Dash 2 Trade. The platform is meant to provide crypto investors and traders with all the tools needed to make smart, informative, and above all — profitable decisions. It offers things like social analytics, trading signals, exchange listing notifications, predictions, and more, all that each trader needs to know before creating a proper strategy and making the best possible move.

The project is currently in the middle of a presale, offering D2T tokens in exchange for Tether (USDT). Each token costs $0.0513 USDT, and right now, there are only 39.4 million D2T remaining. So far, the project has sold more than half of the supply meant for distribution, raising $3.19 million along the way.

DOGE

Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently the best-performing cryptocurrency on the top 10 list, with a 24% increase in the last 24 hours alone. In the last 7 days, the coin has skyrocketed by 77%, and the main reason for this is believed to be Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter. Musk has been a vocal DOGE supporter for years now, and last year, his support of the original memecoin launched DOGE through the roof. In April 2021, the coin went from $0.070 to $0.65 in a single month.

Now, Musk’s completion of the Twitter purchase launched the coin again, sending it from $0.059 on October 25th to $0.10 earlier today. At the time of writing, the coin’s price sits at $0.106, and DOGE is now officially the 8th largest cryptocurrency ba market cap, which currently sits at $13.9 billion.

IMPT

Moving on, we have IMPT, which is a project that calls itself the “greenest cryptocurrency,” and that title already hints at what this project is all about. Essentially, its goal is to provide an impactful carbon offset program that users can participate in simply by investing into the token. In doing so, they will become a part of a large ecosystem that connects businesses and individuals with socially responsible brands, rewarding those who care for the environment and seek to reduce their carbon footprint.

The project is based on Ethereum, and it currently holds a presale where each IMPT token can be purchased for $0.023. So far, it has sold over 626 million units, and it raised $11.3 million, which puts it halfway towards its goal of reaching $25.9 million. The tokens are being sold quickly, and anyone wishing to participate should hurry.

SHIB

Like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a popular memecoin that has captured the attention of the community ever since it appeared. While it is not growing as strongly as DOGE, it has still surged by 22% in the last 7 days and 12% in the last 24 hours alone, which puts its price at the time of writing at $0.00001223. The token also sits as the 13th largest cryptocurrency by market cap right now.

SHIB exceeded DOGE last year, even climbing above it in terms of ranking and market cap. Its price never came close to that of Dogecoin, of course, but the token was dubbed “DOGE killer” for a reason. Whether it can repeat this achievement at some point this year or in 2023 still remains to be seen, but anyone who wants a memecoin other than DOGE will likely not make a mistake by choosing Shiba Inu.

RIA

Finally, we have RIA — a native cryptocurrency of a project called Calvaria. This is a P2E battle card game set beyond the veil of death, as its official page reads. The project allows users to purchase battle cards and then enter duels with other players, upgrade their deck, and earn money along the way. The goal is to become the ultimate force on the battlefield and create the strongest set of cards.

RIA is also holding a presale right now, or rather — it is nearing its end, as it has already sold 50.2 million tokens out of a total of 60 millio, raising 603,904 USDT along the way. With less than 10 million tokens remaining, users are recommended to join the presale as soon as possible, as the tokens will likely not be available for much longer.

The best investment

Out of all of the recommended tokens, D2T is likely the best opportunity right now. When it comes to others, they are each a dominant force in their own niche, be that memecoins, green coins, or metaverse coins. However, D2T offers a platform that provides something that is necessary for each trader and investor out there. This is a necessity, and as such, it is likely to be used by most, if not all, traders and investors.

With D2T token at the heart of it, this will be the cryptocurrency that will be used the most, and as such, it promises the greatest earning potential out of all listed projects.

2022-10-31 04:40:20.032455,ABC,Having an IUD inserted can be excruciatingly painful. Why aren't women being warned or given stronger pain relief?,"""I vomited and passed out twice.""

""As a registered nurse, I was horrified at how played down this was.""

""There was no warning this was the way it was going to happen. It's like living in the dark ages.""

These are the recollections of some Australian patients from the day they got an IUD.

That's an intra-uterine device: a small, plastic contraceptive that sits in the uterus and is one of the most effective forms of preventing pregnancy available.

They are more than 99 per cent effective – more failsafe than the more popular contraceptive pill – and can be used to help manage painful conditions like endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome.

Inserting one is meant to be relatively straightforward, and not too painful, and many people do have good experiences.

But when the ABC asked for your IUD experiences, we received more than 300 responses, many with stories of excruciating pain, vomiting and lasting trauma.

One of the most common complaints was that they were warned only to expect discomfort or cramping, and were completely unprepared for the severe pain that came instead.

What needs to change to make accessing IUDs less painful?

'Why on Earth is it so painful?'

Dakota Wise describes her second IUD insertion as ""traumatic"". ( ABC News: Erin Cooper )

When Dakota Wise was diagnosed with endometriosis at the age of 17, she was willing to try anything that might spare her from the excruciating monthly pelvic pain the condition causes.

""I was fingers and toes crossing for some pain relief [from endometriosis],"" she said.

""I'm really keen to just try anything at this point.""

Two years later, during surgery for her endo, she had a hormonal IUD inserted to lighten her periods.

""I was no longer bleeding during my menstruation. I was not feeling any pain. That was life changing for sure,"" the 25-year-old said.

Replacing the IUD five years later was a no-brainer for Dakota. This time, there was a key difference: she would be awake for the insertion.

And the experience would leave her traumatised.

Dakota can still recall the pain of the IUD insertion. ( Supplied )

Dakota said the doctor at her local family planning clinic in Tasmania had told her she might experience some ""mild cramping"", and advised her to take a couple of paracetamol or ibuprofen an hour beforehand.

""A couple of the girls at work were like 'Oh gosh, you're only taking two Panadol, like are you alright? It's pretty painful' and I said, 'Oh, is it?'""

First, local anaesthetic was sprayed on her cervix, which the doctor had warned could bring on cramping.

That was an understatement compared to what she felt.

""It feels like someone is inside me, grabbing on my organ and twisting it or stabbing it or something.""

""That's when I think I got a little bit worried. I'm thinking, why on earth is it so painful?""

Then came a rod called a ""sound"", used to measure the length of the cervical canal and uterus.

Initially, the doctor used a straighter one, but upon discovering the position of Dakota's uterus, needed to switch to a curved one.

Dakota said the experience was excruciating.

""I'm sitting there like, am I going to pass out? Am I going to throw up? I don't know if I can do this … I am strong, but I don't know if I'm strong enough.""

But the new IUD still had to be inserted.

""I thought, is that a joke? It hasn't been replaced yet? I still have to do more?""

After what felt like about 20 minutes, the IUD finally went in. Dakota had been told the procedure would only take a couple of minutes.

She left the building as fast as she could, then ""sobbed uncontrollably"".

Dakota's medical records describe her insertion as ""routine"" with no complications or abnormalities.

But more than a year later, Dakota can still recall the pain.

""I don't think I felt properly prepared before, during, or after the procedure.

""When it's something like that and it doesn't go to plan, it's not what you thought, it's really hard to get through that.""

What is an IUD?

IUDs are small, plastic ""T"" shaped devices that sit in the uterus.

Hormonal IUDs last for five years. In Australia, there are two types: the Mirena, which is 99.9 per cent effective at preventing pregnancy, and the Kyleena, which is 99.7 per cent effective.

Non-hormonal, copper IUDs last between five and 10 years, depending on the type, and are 99.5 per cent effective.

And while there is an up-front cost to purchase the device and have it inserted, in the long run IUDs can be up to thousands of dollars cheaper than many other contraceptive options.

IUDs are routinely inserted by GPs, family planning doctors and gynaecologists across the country.

The experience will depend on the patient and their own personal medical situation, such as the position of the uterus. It could also depend on the doctor.

The IUD is a small contraceptive device placed inside the uterus. ( ABC News: Emma Machan )

Sydney gynaecologist Professor Kirsten Black said most insertions take her around two minutes.

""I'm quite skilled at it,"" Professor Black said.

""The pain is often very, very quick.""

Some people who answered our call-out experienced that.

""I didn't have any pain relief with the procedure and felt momentary discomfort and was able to walk out of the GP clinic pain free,"" said one person.

""I had an IUD inserted and didn't find it too uncomfortable,"" said another.

But Professor Black said not every insertion was easy.

""Sometimes a person might have a retroverted uterus or a backward-facing uterus.

""It might just be really tricky to get around the corner of the uterus.

""If someone's had a caesarean section … the internal part of the cervix can be a bit scarred.""

Professor Kirsten Black wants better education about, and access to, IUDs in Australia. ( ABC News )

And despite doctors and health workers routinely advising patients like Dakota to take over-the-counter pain medication before the procedure, there's no evidence this does anything to reduce the pain.

Research shows applying topical anaesthetic cream to the cervix may help, but not every doctor's clinic may have that.

Professor Black also said doctor competence may play a role.

""With more volume, clinicians will become more and more skilled, and with greater skill I think the procedure is quicker and less painful,"" she said.

Doctors also face barriers getting trained in IUD insertions.

Courses can have lengthy waiting lists, cost thousands to attend, and require doctors to take time off – which, for GPs, means forgoing profit.

Some patients have queried whether it's just a case of women's pain being downplayed or ignored.

Gino Pecoraro, an obstetrician and gynaecologist and president of the National Association of Specialist Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said that was ""absolutely"" an element.

""I think women's health in this country comes a poor second to men's health.""

Dr Gino Pecoraro wants the Australian government to consider offering free contraception. ( ABC News: Ellie Grounds )

What are doctors told to tell patients about pain?

The family planning organisation in each Australian state and territory runs IUD insertion courses for doctors.

There are also other private training courses, and doctors specialising in gynaecology receive on-the-job training in hospitals.

Trainees at Sexual Health Victoria (SHV), for example, work through six hours of online theory training, before three half-days of supervised insertion placements.

Are you a healthcare worker who has something to share about this story? Email us.

The pain component of the online training is thorough, and includes an extensive list of pain relief options doctors can offer their patients.

Dr Sara Whitburn, the organisation's senior medical educator, said there was a variation in what language doctors may use when telling patients what they can expect during the procedure.

For example, in one training video produced by SHV, a pre-insertion consultation between a real life doctor and an actor patient is played out, and yet the doctor doesn't mention the possibility of severe pain.

Instead, the doctor in the video says the insertion may feel ""quite uncomfortable"" like bad period pain, and uses words like ""discomfort"" and ""pinchy"", but not ""painful"".

But in a video from SHV intended for prospective patients, viewers are told ""there is always some pain associated with having an IUD inserted"" and some women can expect ""moderately severe"" or ""bad"" pain.

An IUD is around three centimetres long. ( ABC News: Emma Machan )

Dr Whitburn said all trainees use a variety of materials to learn about how to best communicate the level of pain patients can expect.

""At Sexual Health Victoria, we do really want to mention pain, talk about pain.""

In the end, it's up to individual doctors as to how much they tell patients about pain and what kind of words they use in front of them.

Professor Kirsten Black said honesty was key.

""I think it's just important to give patients realistic expectations about what to expect, give them options of taking some pain relief beforehand if they want to,"" she said.

She also said doctors should speak openly about sedation as an option for patients who they think might not tolerate the procedure.

But even when patients know what to expect, and adequate pain relief is on offer, accessing it may not be possible.

I want to be put under. Can I be?

Like Dakota, Stevey-Lee Ginger has gone through two insertions and loves her IUD.

After an ""horrific"" first insertion that she described as a ""shit show"", Stevey knew she needed stronger pain relief for her second.

Stevey describes her second IUD insertion as ""capital T trauma"". ( ABC News: Ellie Grounds )

A doctor told her she could have it under general anaesthetic at the nearest day surgery, which was a 45-minute drive away and would require her paying out of pocket.

The twin obstacles of distance and cost were too high, so Stevey decided to get it done at the GP again.

This time she was given some anti-inflammatories and a script for five milligrams of Valium.

Though it went beyond the GP's advice, she decided to up her Valium dose pre-emptively.

""I gave myself triple the amount that they prescribed to me because of the previous experience,"" she said.

""I kind of knew what I was getting in for, so I really wanted to be as loopy as possible or relaxed as possible.""

That, plus the local anaesthetic she was given during the procedure, still wasn't enough to hide the pain.

""If [my mum] hadn't been there giving me the little head rubs, I think I would have passed out.""

Stevey's mum Debbie said she was horrified by what she witnessed her daughter endure.

""[This] seemed like having a tooth pulled without anaesthetic,"" she said.

""Could you imagine it happening to a man? No way.""

Stevey says without her mum Debbie being a ""tether to this realm"" during her second IUD insertion, she would've passed out. ( ABC News: Ellie Grounds )

Many patients find themselves unable to afford a general anaesthetic for IUD insertions.

Technically, this is covered by Medicare, but the reality of the public hospital system makes getting one for free nearly impossible.

The elective procedure can have years-long wait lists, and some public hospitals don't offer contraception services.

""If you're just getting it for contraception, you can't just rock on up to the big local public hospital and say, you know, I've decided I want an IUD, I want to be asleep,"" said Dr Pecoraro.

""I think [it] is really, really, really poor, but it's a function of how overstretched and underfunded they are.""

It means most people who want a general anaesthetic for their insertion have to go private, and fork out hundreds of dollars.

What's the solution?

In early 2022, the former Coalition government increased the Medicare rebate for IUD insertions, making them roughly $20 cheaper.

Even so, it can currently cost a patient up to several hundred dollars to get one, depending on where they go.

This cost deters patients wanting contraception from choosing an IUD, and in turn deters doctors from offering insertions.

Australia has a comparatively low uptake of IUDs for contraception: a 2019 study by the United Nations found only 4.6 per cent of Australian women were using them, compared to 8.3 per cent in the United States and 10.3 per cent in Western Europe.

Earlier this year, a coalition of leading Australian reproductive health experts recommended that the federal government increase the rebate available for inserting long acting reversible contraceptives, which includes IUDs, to try and increase this uptake.

Getting more patients to choose an IUD requires making the insertion process cheaper, easier to access and less painful. But that will only happen if more patients get one inserted. It's a catch-22.

The federal Assistant Minister for Health, Ged Kearney, who is in charge of women's health, is not convinced further increasing the Medicare rebate will make a difference.

""I haven't heard that that last intervention by the previous government has actually increased the uptake or has actually increased the number of GPs who are trained to insert IUDs,"" Ms Kearney said.

When it comes to pain, Ms Kearney said stories like Dakota and Stevey's aren't good enough, but stopped short of any commitment to making stronger pain relief more accessible or affordable.

""It's really terrible to hear those stories … and I'm really sorry about this.

""I think we probably do need to deep dive into this.""","Dakota can still recall the pain of the IUD insertion.
The family planning organisation in each Australian state and territory runs IUD insertion courses for doctors.
Stevey describes her second IUD insertion as ""capital T trauma"".
Stevey says without her mum Debbie being a ""tether to this realm"" during her second IUD insertion, she would've passed out.

2022-10-31 09:40:20.034185,Wide Open Spaces,How to Pack Out an Elk With Horses,"If you've ever bagged an elk, you know how heavy your pack can be once it comes time to bring your quarters home. The first time I went on an elk hunt, my buddy got his first bull during September's archery season in Colorado. We were five miles deep into a wilderness area, and it took two trips to get all the meat out, totaling 20 miles on foot after it was all said and done. Ten of those miles were hiked with 75-pound packs. That was the last time I ever shot an elk that far from my cooler. Man, I wish we'd had horses that day.

Fortunately, if you have access to horses, packing out an elk becomes a lot easier. Horses are a legal method of travel within designated wilderness areas. With the right gear and the right horses, they can pack out your elk for you far easier than you could on your own. Whether you're hunting with an outfitter or doing a DIY hunt with your buddies, horses can make all the difference when it comes to the full big game hunting experience. Here's some information on how to pack out an elk with horses.

Plan Your Pack-Out Early

It only takes one moment for an elk hunt to come to an end. If you didn't alert your buddy who owns horses ahead of your hunt, they may be unavailable to help you pack out your elk meat when the time comes. Pack horses are in high demand come hunting season. It's helpful and considerate to plan your pack-out strategy ahead of time and communicate it to the folks who volunteered to lend you their horses.

Hunters also get brownie points when they already know how to be considerate around horses. Horses get the right of way on all trails, so it's important to step off the trail and out of the way if a horse is coming toward you. It's also good practice to say hello to the rider in advance so the horse knows you're there and won't get spooked when it walks past you. When your buddy rolls in with his pack string of ponies, it'll be easier to pack out your elk if the horses are calm and behaving.

How many horses do you need to pack out an elk?

Horses can comfortably carry about 20 percent of their body weight. Generally, this is between 200-250 pounds, depending on the size of the horse. This is critical to keep in mind when packing out elk meat. The average bull elk yields about 220 pounds of harvestable meat. Cow elk generally yield closer to 170. One small horse could likely pack out a cow elk, and one large horse could probably carry an entire bull's worth of meat. However, it's easier on your horses if you spread out this weight between two of them. Additionally, if you're planning on packing your hunting and camping gear onto your horse, too, you'll definitely need more than one pack horse.

You also can't ride the horse you're packing. For example, if you shoot a small cow elk, you can likely get away with leading one pack horse via a lead rope loaded down with both your elk and your hunting gear. However, if you want to ride out, you'll need a second horse rigged up with a backcountry-friendly saddle and headstall setup. This way, you can ride out of the backcountry while ponying your pack horse behind you. If you're hunting with friends, you may need a horse for each person to ride as well as multiple pack horses to pack out all your gear and elk meat. This is where a pack string comes in; typically, elk hunting outfitters can provide this service for you.

Gear Needed to Pack Out an Elk on a Horse

Pack saddles are essential for packing out elk meat on horseback. Paired with a thick wool saddle pad, pack saddles can be loaded down with panniers or even metal racks. If you're using panniers, elk quarters and hunting gear can be loaded onto each side of your horse. Be careful to evenly distribute the weight of your meat and gear on both sides. Most folks use a ratchet strap or other tether to tie down the skull to the center of the pack saddle. Your pack horse will also need a halter and a lead rope. This allows the horse to remain under your control while you use it for work. You can also loop (not tie) the lead rope to your saddle horn to make for easier ponying if you're riding out, too.

As I mentioned previously, it's important to be considerate of horses while using them to pack out elk meat. Not just any horse can be a pack horse. Whether it's your horse or someone else's, it's likely that you or someone else dumped a ton of time and money into training that horse to be packable. Pack horses need to load into a trailer, be in extremely good physical condition, wear quality horseshoes, work well as a team with other horses, listen to their handler, wear a pack saddle with panniers, and not be alarmed by the scent of dead elk. If you've found a horse that can do all these things confidently and reliably, you're in business!

Meat Care

Even though utilizing pack horses will get your elk meat to your cooler faster, meat care is something that should be on the top of your mind. Prior to being loaded into a pannier, your elk quarters should be stowed in game bags so they're protected against bugs, sticks, dirt, and other debris that's bound to get inside those panniers. It may also be good to line your panniers with trash bags or another protective surface so they don't get stained with elk blood (unless they already are).

If you're packing out elk meat on horseback in grizzly country, be especially bear-aware and know that any large predators could target your pack horse. The slow pony at the end of the line who's walking out of sight or the hobbled horse who's grazing while you eat lunch could be a target that you must be ready to protect.

After all this hard work, don't forget to thank your horse-owning buddy with a couple of cuts of fresh elk meat or an offer to do the same for them sometime. It's a small price to pay for their donated time, skills, and horsepower.

2022-10-31 05:40:20.035970,The Paradise News,Stablecoin HUSD Continues to Trade Below $1 Parity as Token Taps an All-Time Low at $0.72,"By Jamie Redman

After Huobi Global announced that it would be delisting the stablecoin HUSD and auto-converting customer balances 1:1 with tether tokens, the stablecoin asset has dropped significantly in value sliding to a low of $0.72 per unit.

HUSD Remains Below the $1 Peg

Another stablecoin is struggling to maintain parity with the U.S. dollar as HUSD has slipped from the $1 peg to $0.746 per unit on Oct. 30, 2022. At the time of writing, the stablecoin token is exchanging hands for $0.765 per unit and there’s only $59,790 in global trade volume during the past 24 hours.

Two days ago, Bitcoin.com News reported on Huobi Global announcing that it would delist HUSD, a stablecoin asset issued by Stable Universal. While Huobi and the stablecoin shared the same name, and Huobi introduced HUSD on Oct. 19, 2018, the exchange disassociated itself from the stablecoin token this year.

HUSD depegged earlier this year, when it dropped to a low of $0.82 per HUSD on Aug. 18. HUSD also slipped below the $1 parity on Oct. 11 and again on Oct. 28. HUSD tapped an all-time low on Oct. 29, roughly 24 hours ago when it reached $0.725 per unit on Saturday. When the stablecoin slipped below the $1 peg in August, Huobi addressed the problem via Twitter.

“We are aware of the current liquidity issues associated with the HUSD stablecoin, which is issued by Stable Universal Limited and built on the Ethereum network,” Huobi tweeted on Aug. 18. Furthermore, at that time, HUSD’s official Twitter account tweeted about closing several market maker accounts.

“Recently, we had made the decision to close several accounts in specific regions to comply with legal requirements, which included some market maker accounts,” the HUSD Twitter account said on the same day. “Due to the time difference in banking hours, this resulted in a short-term liquidity problem but has since been resolved.”

The official HUSD Twitter account, at least as of Oct. 30, 2022, at 9:30 a.m. (ET), has not tweeted or made any statements since the Aug. 18 tweet when HUSD first started to depeg from the U.S. dollar.

2022-10-31 04:40:20.300860,Herald Sheets,How To Earn Interest From Crypto Saving Accounts,"Speculators now have the option of releasing digitally traded assets into the market, all thanks to the cryptocurrency industry, which has given investors a greater chance to generate a consistent, high-flowing money stream. The public’s enthusiasm for this endeavor has been further boosted by the incorporation of DeFi into the concept of digital currency, and that too, for all good reasons.

Putting an end to the decades-old inefficiencies in cryptocurrency financial services that see money sitting, DeFi has added a spark to the existing crypto phenomenon. A good number of the DeFi technologies that are in use nowadays may have the ability to become large and audacious enough already to compete with existing centralized analogs while continuing to uphold their commitment to their decentralized origins.

Moreover, it is not just about DeFi and, in fact, so much more than that. The mere act of owning cryptocurrency has provided patient investors with the opportunity to earn profits so over the course of time too. Even in the midst of a declining marketplace, there is a variety of additional strategies that may be used to enhance the holdings of digital currencies.

In addition to staking, individual investors now have the option of opening a “crypto savings account” on a number of different cryptocurrency exchanges in order to accumulate cash via the accrual of earnings on their deposited digital currencies through the lending out of their bitcoins or certificates.

Given that they offer substantially larger profits than conventional bank deposit accounts, cryptocurrency savings accounts are especially enticing. This is due to the fact that the average rate of return applied by a cryptocurrency savings account may be as high as 7.5%, whereas bank interest reaches 0.06% at the maximum.

You can see a clear difference between the interest rates of the two and why people are more into depositing their crypto and making interest than traditional banks where so much money is taken away as tax.

One of the fantastic strategies that you may put to use in order to create some money for yourself is to open a crypto savings account. Continue reading this tutorial if you are confused about what this is and how it operates if you are. Hold on tight and keep on with the reading! There is a great deal for you to unearth now!

What are Crypto Saving Accounts?

You may earn interest on virtual currencies that you have invested and committed to loan out in consideration for payback or interest via the use of a service known as a crypto investment account, which is often provided through a DeFi company. This product functions similarly to a deposit or saving account at a traditional bank because it lends your cash to other consumers or investment companies for a specific period of time and pays you income in exchange.

Consumers are intended to become self-sufficient and autonomous from third-party companies while using distributed ledger since this is inherent to the nature of the platform as they are decentralized and involve no mediatory parties. Nevertheless, intermediary businesses have emerged as an indispensable constituent of the crypto economy.

These businesses offer cryptocurrency bank deposits to individuals who wish to reap the advantages of the method without exerting an excessive amount of energy to master its complex and laborious operational procedures.

Aside from facilitating customers, these intermediate organizations likewise make certain that customers are compensated immediately in the event that unfavourable circumstances such as bankruptcy take place. In order to provide enough protection for their clients, several businesses make use of both insurance and the services of reputable custodians.

When you open a savings account and transfer your cryptocurrency holdings into it, you will immediately begin to earn income on those holdings. The majority of the most prominent virtual currencies can be saved in a digital wallet, with Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin being among the most common ones. Many investors, however, place a higher value on the lending rates offered by stablecoins such as Tether, USDC, or Pax Dollar.

When you save your cryptocurrency on a system’s saving profile, you’re giving the service permission to do anything it wants with your funds, including lending them out, speculating them, or even staking them for whatsoever reasons. Its primary purpose is going to be lent out in order to generate maximum return, a portion of which will be distributed to you on a constant schedule in the form of monthly interest installments.

If you consent to keep your cryptocurrency locked away for a certain period of time or if you own a framework-specific asset, some cryptocurrency savings institutions may provide you with more attractive interest payments. On Nexo, for example, those who own the platform’s administration token may benefit from a rise in interest rates up to 4%.

How to Earn Cryptocurrency Interest Using Crypto Saving Accounts

As we discussed earlier that crypto saving accounts are an amazing source of interest on a consistent schedule. Here’s a quick guide for you pertaining to the basic steps you need to follow in order to start reaping crypto-associated profits:

Look for a Reliable Exchange and Sign Up

In order to start accruing interest on existing cryptocurrency investments, you will be required to first locate an online exchange firm. You have to make sure whatever firm you are picking is reliable and has a good reputation in the market, especially when it comes to security, as I am sure no one would want their hard-earned money to go in vain. Once you have located an exchange, you need to create a profile with that firm and sign up for its resources.

At the time of signing up, you might be asked to enter some documents and identification proofs; do as you are asked, as all these steps are taken to ensure the legitimacy of the data. One of the greatest investment-saving exchanges in today’s market is Midas Investments. It offers very competitive market rates, top-tier protection, no minimal reserve requirements, no lock-up durations, and a potent rate-boosting function via the use of its very own native token, MIDAS.

This firm likewise offers annual percentage yields (APY) of 7.8%, 6.5%, and 11.6% on Ether, Bitcoin, and USDT, respectively. Midas is just an example; you can choose any exchange you think would give you the greatest rewards.

Evaluate the Various Interest Rates Offered by the Firm

The homepage of the platform itself displays the interest rates for various digital currencies. However, you may get different interest rates according to whether or not the firm receives a percentage of the earnings, irrespective of the amount of digital asset you have actually invested. These types of deposit accounts often have interest rates that are subject to change on a periodic basis too.

This indicates that the cost of borrowing and lending is variable at all times and is dependent upon the availability and demand for cryptocurrency payments. The greater the demand, the more profit you’d be making out of your investments.

Leveraged speculators and cryptocurrency marketplaces that provide leveraging on their platforms often have a high need for virtual currency loans. A range of 6% to 9% per year is offered as a potential return on investment for stablecoins on average.

The returns on investment for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins offered by Midas Investments are among the highest available. In some cases, interest rates even exceed 100%. Nexo is another reliable platform that may assist you in generating interest in your cryptocurrency holdings.

Nexo is a company that not only provides high returns on stablecoins but also allows customers to earn income on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by using the Nexo network.

On the other hand, what should be noted is that these astronomically rising interest rates ought to serve as a warning sign of extreme crypto inflationary pressures and heavily leveraged holdings. If you are new to the process of getting a return on bitcoin, you should approach any cryptocurrency borrowing costs that seem outrageously high with caution.

Deposit Cryptocurrencies to Your Account

There are a lot of different platforms out there that make it really simple for you to put money into your crypto saving account. You may purchase cryptocurrency straight with your personal bank account on the majority of platforms, such as Uphold and eToro.

If you currently don’t have any cryptocurrencies, this is a simple way to start collecting interest on them. If you want to fund your new registration on a service that only takes cryptocurrencies into account, you’ll open a cryptocurrency exchange account first.

You may send money to the address of your cryptocurrency wallet on the website where you wish to make a profit after you have purchased the cryptocurrency using one of these platforms or another of your choosing.

Gain Interest on Your Money via Those Savings

When you first deposit money into an account that pays interest, you will immediately begin to incur interest on those earnings. Simply sit down, relax with some coffee and observe the value of your cryptocurrency assets rise.

For cryptocurrency speculators who are bullish on the value of Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin over the big scheme of things, accruing earnings in cryptocurrencies might be a highly compelling investment strategy. This is due to the possibility for interest payment on a cryptocurrency to rise at an enormous speed.

Suppose you invested $30,000 worth of bitcoins at the start of the year, and the bitcoin value has since increased to $60,000; your annual interest earnings will be worth twice as much. In addition to something like this, the yield curve of 7% that you obtain on crypto that really is worth $60,000 is twice the dividend yield that you receive on the first transaction that you made.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin are only a few of the most well-known digital currencies for consumers to get interested. Because the income on these funds is paid out in the shape of the cryptocurrencies that are held in your account’s interest-generating account, you are able to maintain your sensitivity to the marketplace in whatever cryptocurrency you have chosen to participate in.

Even individuals who want to minimize their exposure to risk can be interested in some interest-bearing virtual currency transactions. Stablecoins are investment vehicles that are tied to another commodity, most often the United States dollar. Certain technology allows users to open savings institutions denominated in stablecoins and so you can easily locate one for yourself.

DAI, Tether, and USDC are three well-known examples of stable cryptocurrencies that speculators may utilize to generate income. Interest rates for cryptocurrency fluctuate dependent on price and quantity, but they tend to be steady for whatever stablecoin you select.

The majority of the money received by cryptocurrency is at a variable interest rate that fluctuates according to supply and demand. Even if the rate is unpredictable, the APR for the majority of bigger currencies is quite consistent. As an illustration, the lending interest costs on Bitcoin often run anywhere from 4% to 8%.

How Do You “Stake” Your Cryptocurrency?

If users make the decision to stake their cryptocurrency monies, their primary choices will be to accomplish this via CEXs or to participate in the public ledger directly. Involvement in a blockchain network can either be accomplished directly through the operation of a validating node or through involvement in a staking pool. By contributing to the blockchain by operating a validator node, you may immediately receive staking benefits.

Nevertheless, the prerequisites in terms of both the technological installation and the minimal expenditure are often substantial. For instance, in order to operate a validator node onboard Ethereum, you will be required to install the full blockchain, be accessible at all moments to prevent being penalized for “slashing,” and execute all of the necessary software.

Immediate resources for validating nodes are likewise much further from basic. As an example, Ethereum validators are required to stake a minimum of 32 ETH. This is really expensive and challenging for novice traders to manage for all obvious reasons. You may choose to engage in indirect staking by joining a staking pool instead of engaging in direct staking.

These pools are managed by staking internet services that can continue providing you with the opportunity to take part while requiring substantially less monetary and operational obligations from you. Engaging in a staking pool, on the other hand, renders you reliant on the staking pool’s administrator and decreases your autonomy in contrast to staking directly on a blockchain.

Staking on a crypto exchange (CEX) can be a better option for you than staking on a network, either on your own or as part of a community. The CEX approach is preferred by many cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and customers since it is less expensive, carries less danger, and requires fewer technical skills. This is mostly the result of two important things, namely, the safety of your cash and the quality of help provided to consumers.

The major cryptocurrency exchanges are the company’s leading trading marketplaces for cryptocurrencies. In comparison to blockchain networks and DApps, their protection configurations and service and support are significant benefits. Some possible cyber assaults on a blockchain might result in the theft of cash if they are not quickly recovered.

On the other hand, you could keep your cash safer by using a custodial wallet that would be hosted on a prominent cryptocurrency exchange. This would put your funds in a position where they would be less susceptible to being stolen. It should come as no surprise that CEXs might also be the target of cyber assaults.

This is why such institutions have made the prevention of cyberattacks an essential component of their whole business strategy. Therefore, custodial wallets on some of these CEXs provide a level of security that is superior to that offered by non-custodial blockchain wallets.

Conclusion

For a long time, cryptocurrencies have been hailed as the destiny of finances; nevertheless, it was not until the year 2020 that they definitely grasped an ancient concept, which is generating money off of money. Though this idea was new and a lot of people were reluctant to invest in it, it didn’t take long for these currencies to dominate the financial markets. Decentralized finance, also known as DeFi, is a term used in the digital currency market to describe a broad range of blockchain-based implementations.

These developments are designed to improve the profitability that cryptocurrency owners receive without depending on a financial intermediary to earn any yields. These kinds of programs are extremely effective for making earnings since the benefit is going just to you and no one else.

Signing up for an established cryptocurrency exchange, making a cash deposit, and then patiently waiting for your returns are the three steps needed to generate income on your cryptocurrency investments. It is in your best interest to utilize these accounts rather than letting your digital assets lie in a dormant state.","On Nexo, for example, those who own the platform’s administration token may benefit from a rise in interest rates up to 4%.

But for the previous few months, bitcoin’s value has bounced stubbornly round $20,000 in an indication that volatility out there has settled.

An end to crypto winter?

Cryptocurrencies have suffered a brutal comedown this year, losing $2 trillion in value since the height of the 2021 rally. Bitcoin, the world’s biggest digital coin, is off around 70% from its November peak. The current so-called “crypto iciness” is largely the result of aggressive tightening from the Fed, which has been hiking interest rates in an effort to tame rocketing inflation. Large crypto investors with highly leveraged bets like Three Arrows Capital were floored by the pressure on prices, further accelerating the market’s drop.
