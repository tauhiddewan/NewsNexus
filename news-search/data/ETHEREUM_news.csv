2022-10-31 07:43:01.558252,AMBCrypto,"Ethereum: Decoding if ETH would lose sight of $1,600 and its dominance over this…","As October nears its end, Ethereum [ETH] has been able to sustain its price dominance over Bitcoin [BTC] with signs to even command better. An overview of the last thirty days showed that ETH increased 21.52% while trading at $1,628 at press time. According to CoinMarketCap, BTC’s rise within the same period was a minimal 6.55%.

Here’s AMBCrypto’s Price Prediction for Ethereum for 2022-2023

According to Santiment, BTC was less likely to win the “battle” anytime soon. The on-chain analytic platform reported that the ETH had gained new addresses much better than that of the king coin. However, the increase had not impacted much on the network growth which decreased to 65,600.

Normally, an increase in active addresses should lead to a rise in the network growth. In turn, this should impact the price barring any other external factors.

Time to do more or else…

The on-chain analytic platform noted that ETH might need more than the current active addresses momentum to maintain the price rise. If not, the number one altcoin might lose its grip on the $1,600 region, and possibly squander the dominance it held for months. So, is there a chance that other parts of the Ethereum chain are making up for the minimal address increase?

According to Glassnode, it seemed that retail investors formed a large part of the new addresses gained. This was because the addresses with 1,000 to 10,000 ETH had decreased. At press time, addresses with 10,000 ETH were 1,160— a reduction from 1,165 on 28 October.

In comparison with the addresses with 0.1 ETH and 1 ETH, the deep-pocket investors were accumulating really low. As of this writing, the retail unique addresses count had massively increased. The implications of this trend was that ETH had potential to surpass the $1,600 zone considering that addresses continue to spike. Moreover, the coin might need a better impact from institutional investors to sustain the current momentum.

ETH might require more action

While ETH might have done well with its smart contracts supply, maintaining its dominance might require more than investor activity. For context, the network responsiveness might need to play a major role. However, the ETH participation rate had not been able to match up the validator impact on 26 October. At press time, Glassnode data showed that the participation rate was 99.09%. At this rate, slots missed by network validators were minimal. Still, it had the potential to be better.

Interestingly, the current ETH price stood more profitable for investors. As revealed by Glassnode, the ETH supply in profit was 56.78 million. With the performance of these metrics, it was highly likely that ETH would see the BTC dominance till year end.","As October nears its end, Ethereum [ETH] has been able to sustain its price dominance over Bitcoin [BTC] with signs to even command better.

Bitcoin continues to flirt with stiff resistance.

Ethereum is approaching tough resistance as well.

Are BTC/ USD and ETH/USD turning bearish? What is the outlook?

Recommended by Manish Jaradi Get Your Free Bitcoin Forecast Get My Guide

BITCOIN SHORT-TERM TECHNICAL OUTLOOK - NEUTRAL

In recent days, Bitcoin has struggled to break past key resistance at the early-October high of 20465. On its own, this may not be a bearish sign (or a reversal sign of the minor uptrend). Considering the pace and the extent of the fall, corrective rebounds have been feeble and shallow this year.

Moreover, the early-October high of 20465 is not the only resistance that BTC/USD is grappling with. It is also weighed by the 89-day moving average, which has capped most rallies this year. Hence, a break above converged resistance would be bullish. That could pave the way towards the September high of 22774. The major topside barrier from there is at the August high of 25201, near the 200-day moving average.

BTC/USD Daily Chart

Chart Created Using TradingView

Bitcoin’s rise in recent days has raised hopes for a broader recovery. However, it is too soon to conclude that the worst is over. At this point, the current recovery doesn’t appear to be any different from the January-March or the mid-2022 rebounds. For a rise to be more than a short-term dead-cat bounce, BTC/USD needs to break above the August high of 25201 at minimum. On the downside, for the short-term outlook to turn bearish, BTC/USD needs to fall below the June low of 17590.

{{GUIDE|THE_FUNDAMENTALS_OF_TREND_TRADING}}

ETHEREUM SHORT-TERM TECHNICAL OUTLOOK - NEUTRAL

ETH/USD’s two-week-long rally is approaching stiff resistance, pointing to the possibility of a pause. This wouldn’t necessarily mean that the nascent rebound is over. ETH/USD would need to break below immediate support at the Friday low of 1482 to confirm that the short-term uptrend had changed.

ETH/USD Daily Chart

Chart Created Using TradingView

Last week’s jump to 1662 also meant that the price objective of the sideway pattern was met. However, ETH/USD is now testing a tough hurdle on the 200-day moving average (currently at about 1693). This resistance is quite strong – the last time ETH/USD was decisively above the long-term moving average was in 2021. So, a decisive break above the 200-day moving average could have implications for the medium-term trend. Subsequent resistance is at the September high of 1790, followed by the August high of 2031.

On the downside, 1482 is key support – ETH/USD needs to hold above this level for the uptrend to remain in place. However, any break below 1482 could pave the way towards a horizontal trendline from August (at about 1409). Pushing below that would raise the risk of a retest of the September-October lows of around 1193-1220.

At press time, Ether is trading at 0.077 BTC, aiming for a third consecutive day in the green.

The ETH/BTC pair peaked at 0.085 BTC on Sept. 8. However, it then declined more than 12% in the run-up to the much-hyped “Merge” upgrade, which ended up being a “sell the news” event.

Ethereum peaked at 0.088 BTC last December after the latest bull run came to a grinding halt.

It is worth noting that the ETH/BTC pair is still down 50% from its all-time peak of 0.156 that was reached in June 2017.

Pal’s price predictions should be taken with a huge grain of salt. Last September, he said that the Ether price would hit $20,000 by the end of the year. In November, he doubled down on his bullish call after the price of Ethereum reached the top of the previous cycle.

Now, ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin, one of the most respected voices in the bitcoin and crypto community, has issued a ""controversial"" crypto adoption warning—flying in the face of growing excitement that crypto could be hurtling toward a $10 trillion earthquake.

""I don't think we should be enthusiastically pursuing large institutional capital at full speed,"" Buterin posted to Twitter, calling the take ""maybe-controversial."" ""I'm actually kind of happy a lot of the [exchange-traded funds] are getting delayed. The ecosystem needs time to mature before we get even more attention.""

The crypto market has cheered multiple ""huge milestones"" in recent months, including news BlackRock BLK , the world’s largest asset manager with $10 trillion in assets under management, has partnered with major crypto exchange Coinbase to provide its institutional clients with access to bitcoin.

Financial services giant Fidelity this week surveyed over 1,000 institutional investors, finding almost 75% of them plan to buy cryptocurrencies in the future, it was reported by Blockworks.

Last year, the launch of the first U.S. bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) helped the bitcoin price hit its all-time high of almost $70,000—boosting the ethereum price and other major cryptocurrencies. Since then, a handful of applications for a fully-fledged U.S. bitcoin ETF have been rejected by regulators.

In recent months, much of the crypto debate has focused on looming regulations in the U.S. and worldwide that some fear could stifle innovation and development. Crypto billionaire and chief executive of the FTX crypto exchange Sam Bankman-Fried has attracted criticism for proposals that would see users of automated decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols required to share their data with companies and regulators.

2022-10-31 08:43:01.603805,NewsBTC,Ethereum Scores Over 22% Gains While Solana Recorded 15%,"After facing a market-wide correction, several coins, including Ethereum and Solana, have recorded substantial gains in the past week. Earlier today, Ethereum reached a 24-hour high of $1,652 before dropping to $1,602 at press time. The Ethereum killer Solana also peaked at $33.74 on the day. However, it has fallen to $32.66.

Although both have suffered some losses on the day, the coins have kept impressive profits in the last seven days. The top-ten tokens by market cap recorded a weekly gain of over 10%. Ethereum and Solana are poised to finish the month of October strong if they continue at this pace.

Ethereum Breaks Through $1.6k. What To Expect Next

After months of decline, the price of Ethereum appears to be following the market’s lead. It found key support near the $1250 level, pushing its price above the descending channel pattern. The price is testing and likely breaking above the major negative trendline.

According to traditional price action, the market should be able to break over the $2,000 resistance level relatively easily. Anyway, the 200-day moving average is hovering around the $1700 mark, which might be a significant barrier for Ethereum. After months of slumping, Ethereum’s structure would turn bullish if the price breaks above the moving average and the $2000 zone. As a result, ETH’s price can go up in the mid-term.

The 4-hour chart is similarly bullish, with the market impulsively breaking over the $1400 level and heading into the $1800 barrier area. However, a bearish divergence is visible in the current RSI indicator. There appear to be limited static resistance points before the $1800 level. Therefore, a correction or reversal may be on the horizon in response to this signal. The $1400 level might act as a critical support level and propel the price higher if a major correction occurs.

How Solana Is Fairing: Looking At The Charts

Solana currently trades at $32.66, with a 24-hour volume of $1,166,152,851. The price of Solana has fallen by less than 1% in the last day. Over the past day, trading volumes have reduced marginally. Plus, the altcoin’s Volume to Market Cap Ratio is still quite low.

SOL Coin’s price peaked at $260.06 on November 6, 2021, and it has struggled to recover to that level ever since. At present, the Solana price is rising, and the coin is trading above the 20, 50 simple moving averages with a bullish bias. This suggests that it may retest the $35 barrier level. Moreover, a golden cross is imminent as the 20 SMA on the four-hour chart has recently crossed above the 200 SMA. But the support is currently at $30.

Several indicators suggest bullish momentum for Solana. Firstly, the signal line is above the MACD line, approaching a positive zone. An additional piece of evidence supporting the bullish case is the growing histograms. The relative strength index (RSI) is currently at 57.91. This is favorable for the bulls but is quickly approaching overbought levels. As a whole, the market is bullish based on these readings.

After a torrid month of downward trends and gradually decreasing in value, the two top cryptocurrencies seem to be on the rise again.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is priced at $20,632.02, rising from around $19,000 in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum has jumped from roughly $1,300 to over $1,500.

Indeed, October is the month when crypto seems to flourish. A little more than a year ago, Bitcoin reached one of its highest points at $64,284.59 whereas Ethereum surpassed $4,000.

And then in November, both cryptocurrencies went on to achieve their most lucrative prices ever.

The point is Autumn is the perfect time to invest in coins that are still in their presale, like Big Eyes Coin (BIG). It doesn’t make sense to stake your hold in the crypto big boys at the moment as the initial investment is more costly.

Regardless, with the crypto economy about to go through a purple patch, newcomers like Big Eyes Coin are likely to raise greater funds, from an increased interest in the crypto industry.

Make The Big Bucks With Bitcoin

Bitcoin was created in 2009 as an alternative to a fiat-based currency like pounds, dollars, and euros. More than ten years later, no one could have predicted how remunerative the coin has become.

Those who invested in Bitcoin near its inception and have withdrawn their funds made life-changing amounts of profit.

Bitcoin is also gradually being accepted as a mainstream currency and high-profile companies such as Wikipedia, Microsoft, and Burger King already accept the coin as a legitimate form of payment.

Invest In Ethereum And Facilitate The Creation Of Decentralized Applications

Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum is accepted by an array of companies as payment too, like Travala, Amazon, and Overstock.

However, in contrast, Ethereum’s value derives from the immense technological value that it provides the crypto universe.

Ethereum allows developers to create decentralized applications without the involvement of a third party. Therefore, companies and individuals have free reign over the apps created and everything can be kept completely anonymous.

Big Eyes Coin Is Here To Revamp Meme Currencies

Big Eyes Coin is the new crypto on the scene, yet with over 8.5 million dollars raised during presale and the securing of a Tier 1 CEX Launch, the meme currency has phenomenal potential in the market.

Branded with cute cats, Big Eyes Coin is set to compete with dog coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) which have historically dominated the economy.

For a start, Big Eyes coin intends to release top ten NFTs. Their NFT Sushi Crew will allow investors to own a range of cute items while interacting in a fun-filled community of cat lovers.

Additionally, Big Eyes coin wants to make a positive difference in the environment by cleaning up the oceans. The cat coin intends to donate 5% of its total supply to ocean-saving charities, meaning less global warming and more healthy fish.

And if this isn’t enough incentive to invest in Big Eyes Coin, the code BEYES578 can be used to gain a bonus on coins purchased.

Why It Matters: While the two largest coins, Bitcoin and Ethereum, were in the red, the rise in Dogecoin continued unabated.

The meme coin has shot up a whopping 103.85%, buoyed by Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter, in the last seven days. In the same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have risen 5.3% and 16.5%, respectively.

Dogecoin’s 24-hour trading volume declined 35.76% to $8.03 billion at the time of writing. Coinglass data indicated that $27.58 million worth of DOGE was liquidated over 24 hours.

On Sunday evening, the two cryptocurrencies with the largest market cap were seen trading in negative territory with other major risk assets like stocks. U.S. stock futures were marginally in the red.

This week, investors will be on the lookout for the latest policy meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve which commences Tuesday.

Going forward into the fresh trading week, there has been a marked improvement in investor sentiment. Alternative.me’s “Crypto Fear & Greed Index” was seen pointing to “Fear” at the time of writing.

The index showed a value of 31, last week it was at “22” and flashed “Extreme Fear.” A value of 0 on the measure is construed as “Extreme Fear,” while 100 is “Extreme Greed.”

2022-10-31 05:43:01.923147,Decrypt,What Are Nouns? The Ethereum NFT DAO Building Open-Source IP,"Pixel art NFTs are nothing new—one of the first NFT collections, CryptoPunks, pioneered the blocky 8-bit design style.

But Nouns is shaking things up with a novel distribution method and open-source IP that has led to the collection's signature pixelated specs popping up everywhere from beer cans to movies.

Here’s how Nouns works, and how it has built a multimillion-dollar decentralized brand.

What are Nouns?

First and foremost, Nouns is an NFT collection, whose owners are part of Nouns DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are cryptographically unique crypto tokens that are often used to represent a piece of digital art. Nouns are an example of a profile picture (PFP) collection, a set of NFTs that are typically used as a user’s profile image on social media platforms.

Nouns are also a creative experiment on Ethereum designed to improve how on-chain communities interact. The Nouns DAO does this by using its treasury to build and support public goods.

A little over a year has passed since the first Nouns NFT (a pixel art character with a fox head and pink glasses) was auctioned on Ethereum. In that time, the Nouns DAO has steadily grown and now holds just over 29,000 ETH (about $45 million) in its treasury—a war chest used to fund a diverse range of initiatives from charity donations to naming a new species of frog.

Who invented Nouns?

The Nouns concept was inspired by a Twitter prompt from an anonymous founding member, Punk 4156. After interest grew for the idea, he followed it up with a series of tweets outlining the framework that would invariably become Nouns.

Shortly after, a group of ten Nounders (what Nouns calls its co-founders), including Vine founder Dom Hofmann, began working through a shared Discord and created the DAO, using Punk 4156’s outline as a guide to solidify the concept.

What’s so special about Nouns?

Each Noun NFT is a little picture of a humanoid that has been algorithmically generated to order, then stored as a 32-pixel by 32-pixel picture directly on the Ethereum blockchain.

The fact that Nouns are stored directly on Ethereum’s scarce blockspace, rather than containing a link to an image hosted elsewhere (for instance on decentralized web hosting service IPFS), is a notable difference between Nouns and many other NFT projects.

The algorithm that underlies the Nouns protocol forges these NFTs from a random combination of backgrounds, body types and clothes. Some of these Nouns have flipbook calendars for heads. Others sport jumpers with geometric shapes.

You can play around with potential Nouns in the Nouns Playground, a tool that lets you combine various traits stored in the protocol.

Unlike the limited supply and exclusive nature of PFP NFTs like CryptoPunks or Bored Ape Yacht Club, a new Noun is generated randomly every 24 hours and put up for auction. Once each auction closes, another unique Noun is minted (based on a series of predefined traits), and the process repeats, forever. The Nouns smart contract automatically sends 100% of the proceeds directly to the DAO Treasury.

What is the Nouns DAO?

Every Nouns owner can join the Nouns DAO to help shape and govern the project by voting on proposals funded by the Treasury. The DAO, which uses a fork of Compound Governance, gives all members one vote per Nouns NFT. Although these votes are non-transferrable, as with using proxies for board meetings, members of the DAO can delegate other people to vote on their behalf should the person or entity delegating still own the Noun used to vote.

Although there's no cap on the number of Nouns a single entity or person can own, a minimum of two Nouns are required to submit proposals. And the founding members receive rewards in the form of Nouns (10% of the supply, or every tenth Noun, for the first five years).

Every Noun holder can sponsor and vote on proposals for the treasury to fund. The idea is that the more unique and interesting said projects are, the more brand awareness Nouns gains, and the more people will want to join.

To date, the Nouns DAO has funded proposals including:

🏈 Feature Nouns in a Super Bowl commercial – The proposal involved offering one Nouns NFT from the DAO to a company that would feature the iconic Nouns glasses in a 2022 Super Bowl commercial; the NFT eventually went to Bud Light, which duly aired the commercial during the much-coveted ad slot. As part of the deal, Bud Light also changed its Twitter profile picture to a Nouns NFT.

How to buy a Nouns NFT

Nouns are offered at auction on the Nouns website, with a new Noun generated and offered for sale every 24 hours. They are also available on secondary markets such as OpenSea and Rarible.

As of October 30, 2022, the Nouns floor price is over 60 ETH (about $93,000). One reason for the big sticker price is that the supply of Nouns is very limited, because just one Nouns NFT is released a day. Where NFT collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks typically number in the thousands of units, there are just 491 Nouns at the time of writing.

Did you know? Despite its high floor price, Nouns is just the 232nd largest NFT project with $23.3 million in secondary market sales, according to data from CryptoSlam. By comparison, Axie Infinity, the largest NFT project, has generated about $4 billion in secondary market sales.

Nouns and open-source IP

Nouns is open-source and is released under a Creative Commons CC0 “No Rights Reserved” license. This means that anyone can use the Nouns name and imagery to create anything, as it’s in the public domain.

Even if you don’t own a Nouns NFT, you can create Nouns merchandise, and people have created derivative NFT collections such as Noundles, Lil’ Nouns, 3D Nouns, and NounPunks.

You’re also free to add new traits for future Nouns. The only caveat is that the Nouns codebase, including the art within it, is principally governed by the Nouns DAO, which votes on which traits are included in the collection. The DAO receives all of the ETH used to buy Nouns.

As of this writing, the treasury holds about $45 million. This money is used for “the long-term growth and prosperity of the Nouns project.” Nouns holders can vote on proposals submitted by other Nouns holders.

Discussion for Nouns takes place on Discord and the forum site Discourse. The latter is where intense discussion around protocol governance takes place.

Successful votes on the governance protocol, which is modeled after Compound Governance, include a motion to establish brand presence in Brazil (expect merch) and design and distribute a monthly Nouns comic for distribution across the U.S. (expect anthropomorphic Nouns). Nouns DAO is also one of the crowdfunding backers of feature film ""Calladita,"" in what’s thought to be the first on-chain proposal for a DAO to fund a feature film; the deal will see a Nouns NFT featured on-screen in the film.

The future of Nouns

Despite its name, the Nouns DAO is not entirely decentralized—yet. The Nouns Foundation, an “ownerless” Cayman Foundation Company set up by the Nounders, has the ability to veto proposals it doesn’t like, such as those that “introduce non-trivial legal or existential risks to the Nouns DAO or the Nouns Foundation.” This refers to treasury raids, bribes, unwanted updates to the Nouns smart contracts, or attempts to control the Nouns auction process to get a voting majority.

It remains to be seen whether handing intellectual property rights to a community straight away, and focusing on the governance of a brand, makes a material difference to its value.

But so far, Nouns NFTs have become a recognizable part of the NFT ecosystem, and the Nouns governance structure has worked impressively well, taking the project beyond little pixellated blobs with tacos and airplanes for heads.","First and foremost, Nouns is an NFT collection, whose owners are part of Nouns DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization.

2022-10-31 02:43:01.952380,CoinCodex,Binance NFT—Explore and Trade NFTs on BNB Chain and Ethereum,"Non-fungible tokens, better known simply as NFTs, are a type of digital token on the blockchain that’s used to create unique digital objects. NFTs can be tied to various pieces of media, such as pictures, videos or audio. However, their potential use also extends beyond media, as NFTs can be used to represent things like event tickets, physical objects, video game items, or even real estate.

NFTs exploded in popularity in 2021 thanks to PFP (profile picture) NFT projects like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club. These types of NFTs allow users to own a visually unique avatar to represent their identity on the web.

NFTs are traded on a variety of NFT marketplaces. The most popular option at the moment is OpenSea, although the competition is certainly not sleeping. Cryptocurrency exchanges have recognized that the demand for NFTs is substantial and users now have a wide variety of NFT trading platforms to choose from.

Binance, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency exchange, entered the NFT world in a big way with the launch of the Binance NFT marketplace in June 2021. Since launch, the platform has seen a slew of improvements, making it one of the most convenient places for users to mint, buy and sell NFTs.

Trade NFTs on Binance NFT

Why use Binance NFT for trading NFTs?

With so many NFT marketplaces available at the moment, it’s hard to decide which one to go with. Realistically, one of the main reasons to choose a particular platform is the blockchain platform(s) that it supports. Some marketplaces are focused on a single blockchain, while others can be used to trade NFTs on multiple blockchains.

Binance NFT does well here because it supports NFTs on both the Ethereum and BNB Chain platforms. This selection covers a lot of ground, as they are two of the most popular blockchains out there.

A key aspect to consider when choosing an NFT marketplace is the user experience. Ideally, the platform should make it easy to find specific NFTs you’re interested in, or explore NFT collections that you might not be familiar with.

This simplicity should also extend to payments, as the process of buying and selling should be quick and simple with convenient payment options. Binance NFT supports payments in ETH, BNB and the BUSD stablecoin. Selling an NFT on Binance NFT comes with a 1% fee, which is a competitive fee rate.

Another advantage of using Binance NFT is that the exchange offers 24/7 customer support-this isn’t something that you can expect from most other NFT marketplaces.

Now that we’re familiar with some of the basics, let’s take a closer look at the Binance NFT marketplace and what it offers to NFT collectors and traders. We’ll also show you how to buy an NFT on Binance. Before getting started, we’ll have to create an account on Binance. Please note that you have to complete an identity verification process if you want to use Binance’s services.

If you want to buy an NFT, you’ll have to top up your funding wallet with some crypto. Currently, you can top up the wallet with either ETH, BNB or BUSD. You don’t have to worry about this right now, as you will be given the option to top up your wallet when you try to buy an NFT (if you don’t have sufficient funds in your funding wallet).

Finding the right NFT

Of course, the first step is to actually find a cool NFT that you would like to buy. Thankfully, the Binance NFT platform makes it very easy to sort between all of the NFTs available on the marketplace and find the right one for you. Let’s head on over to the “Marketplace” section using the navigation bar.

On the left side of the user interface, you’ll see a wealth of options for filtering between different NFTs. The first choice to make is “Asset Type”. This will allow you to choose if you only want to see regular NFTs, or if you also want to view mystery boxes.

Mystery boxes are a digital product that contain a random NFT from the associated collection. The upside is that you have a chance of opening an NFT of a higher rarity, but the downside is that you don’t know exactly what you’re going to get. We will be sticking to regular NFTs for now, but the choice is up to you.

If you know exactly which NFT collection you’re interested in, use the “Collections” section. You can also scroll this menu to view a list of the different NFT collections offered on the marketplace. Just as an example, let’s say that we want to see NFTs from the TUD NFT collection.

Since TUD NFT is an example of a Premier Collection, this is a good time to explain Binance NFT’s system of categorizing NFT collections as either Premium Collections or Standard Collections.

Premier Collections

Binance NFT categorizes some NFT collections as Premier Collections based on various factors. According to Binance, this can include factors like trading volume, sales volume, as well as the number of followers the collection has on Binance NFT and other social media platforms.

You can easily identify Premier Collections by the orange tick that is displayed next to the collection’s name.

This categorization can help you more easily identify popular and high-quality NFT collections, although it shouldn’t be seen as a strict rule. In other words, just because a collection is categorized as a Premier Collection is not a guarantee that it will go up in value or have long-term appeal.

Standard Collections

Simply put, all collections on Binance NFT that aren’t Premier Collections are categorized as Standard Collections. For example, if you were to launch an NFT collection through Binance NFT right now, it would be categorized as a Standard Collection at first.

The Standard Collection designation by itself does not imply that the collection is low quality. However, you might want to be a bit more careful and do some extra research before buying an NFT from a Standard Collection.

The platform will display a risk reminder whenever you’re viewing an NFT from a Standard Collection.

Other filtering options

You can also filter NFTs by a number of other parameters. Let’s take a quick look at some examples.

Sale types: Filter NFTs according to how they’re being sold. You can choose between “Fixed Price” and “Live Auction” sales. You can also choose to only view NFTs that already have buy offers.

Buying an NFT

Once you find an NFT you’re interested in, you can go ahead and purchase it. There are two ways that NFTs are being sold on Binance NFT.

Fixed price

An NFT owner can decide to list their NFT for sale at a fixed price. If you find the price to be fair and want to purchase the NFT, simply click the “Buy Now” button.

If you think it’s possible to get a better deal, click the “Make Offer” button to make your offer. The NFT in our example is being listed at a fixed price of 440 BUSD. Here’s how you would go about making an offer for 400 BUSD.

After making an offer, the funds will be frozen until the offer expires or is canceled. If the offer is accepted, the funds will be automatically moved to the seller and you will receive the NFT.

Auctions

Some sellers decide to put their NFTs up for auction instead of listing them at a fixed price. You can make a bid by offering more than the current highest bid. Each auction has a minimum markup - for example, if the current highest bid is 300 BUSD and the minimum markup is 1 BUSD, you have to bid at least 301 BUSD.

After placing a bid on an NFT auction, your funds will be frozen until someone else places a higher bid, or until the auction ends (if you have the highest bid).

The bottom line - Binance NFT is a solid NFT marketplace for BNB Chain and Ethereum

Binance has successfully created an NFT marketplace that’s user-friendly both in terms of convenience and costs. With Binance NFT, it’s easy to find exactly the NFT you like among the sea of digital collectibles that are available. The platform’s multi-chain support as well as the fact that you can use BNB, BUSD or ETH make it suitable for almost any crypto enthusiast.

Binance caters a lot to the BNB Chain ecosystem, and has many features that make life easier for BNB Chain users. From my experience, the Binance NFT marketplace seems best suited for BNB Chain NFT collections, although you can definitely also find some interesting Ethereum-based NFTs on the platform.","Trade NFTs on Binance NFTWhy use Binance NFT for trading NFTs?

David Schwartz, Ripple’s chief technology officer, has defended XRP’s price performance in a recent tweet.

After a disgruntled investor called the cryptocurrency’s price “a disgrace,” Schwartz explained that the Ripple-affiliated token is actually performing in line with other major cryptocurrencies.

The Ripple executive has noted that one’s perception of XRP’s price performance depends on a specific timeframe.

Schwartz has pointed to the fact that XRP has outperformed both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on a year-to-date basis. For instance, ETH is down, but XRP is down 45%.

However, it should be noted that XRP is still down a staggering 86.41% from its all-time high that was reached all the way back in January 2018. It is one of the few major cryptocurrencies that failed to reach new peaks during the latest bull market cycle.

Yet, despite facing plenty of legal uncertainty due to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple, XRP managed to remain among the leading cryptocurrencies.

According to data provided by CoinMarketCap, it is currently valued at an impressive $23.2 billion, which makes it the sixth-biggest cryptocurrency (behind only Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, BNB, and USD Coin).

Many of the proponents of the controversial cryptocurrency believe that a potentially positive outcome in the Ripple case could be a major tailwind for the token.","The architect of the XRP Ledger has defended the sluggish price performance of the sixth-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalizationDavid Schwartz, Ripple’s chief technology officer, has defended XRP’s price performance in a recent tweet.

2022-10-31 02:43:01.968016,The Coin Republic,zkSync Launches Despite Criticism All Over,"On Friday 28th October 2022, the much awaited Ethereum rollup from Matter Labs dubbed as zkSync released. It is said to be the second version of Ethereum scaling platform from its developer.

Before the much-anticipated “Baby Alpha” launch, zkSync, an Ethereum “rollup” network that enables users to transact swiftly and affordably without sacrificing security, came under fire from doubters and rivals leery of its most bold technological claims.

In particular, Matter Labs’ marketing of the zkSync v2 platform as the first of its sort to “launch” on Ethereum’s mainnet, defeating quickly approaching rivals from Polygon and Scroll, has come under fire.

Although the platform is now active on Ethereum’s main network, for the time being it will have very few functionalities. The Baby Alpha launch, according to Matter Labs’ official road map, will not be open to outside projects but will instead be used to put zkSync’s systems “through a series of real-money stress tests that will help us verify the production system is operating as intended and is performing as expected.”

According to the road map, a “Fair Launch” with access to outside teams would occur soon.

The first of three anticipated zkEVM projects to deploy in some capacity on Ethereum’s mainnet is zkSync, even though access to its v2 network will initially be highly limited. All of the projects promise to be compatible with any Ethereum smart contract and to outperform the network’s existing scaling solutions in terms of security and efficiency.

The majority of network activity is anticipated to occur through layer 2 rollup platforms in the upcoming years as a result of the Ethereum community’s adoption of a rollup-centric road map, which addresses Ethereum’s exorbitant fees and slow speeds. Layer 2 rollup platforms are quick and inexpensive networks that sit on top of Ethereum.

A layer 2 network called zkSync is a “zero-knowledge” (ZK) rollup that combines user transactions and sends them to Ethereum so that they can be added to its ledger. ZK-rollups use intricate cryptographic proofs to demonstrate the integrity of the data they transmit to Ethereum.

The bite-sized computer programmes that power apps on Ethereum, known as “smart contracts,” will all be fully interoperable with zkSync’s v2 platform, in contrast to the previous version of its rollup.","On Friday 28th October 2022, the much awaited Ethereum rollup from Matter Labs dubbed as zkSync released.
Before the much-anticipated “Baby Alpha” launch, zkSync, an Ethereum “rollup” network that enables users to transact swiftly and affordably without sacrificing security, came under fire from doubters and rivals leery of its most bold technological claims.
In particular, Matter Labs’ marketing of the zkSync v2 platform as the first of its sort to “launch” on Ethereum’s mainnet, defeating quickly approaching rivals from Polygon and Scroll, has come under fire.
Although the platform is now active on Ethereum’s main network, for the time being it will have very few functionalities.
The first of three anticipated zkEVM projects to deploy in some capacity on Ethereum’s mainnet is zkSync, even though access to its v2 network will initially be highly limited.",9 hours ago,"['zksync', 'criticism', 'v2', 'projects', 'despite', 'ethereum', 'platform', 'rollup', 'road', 'ethereums', 'launch', 'launches', 'network']"

2022-10-30 11:43:02.320217,Coinpedia,"Uniglo.io, Monero And Ethereum Classic Are Bound To Explode In 2023","The bear market fills new investors with fear as they watch the value of their portfolios nosedive. Investors who have witnessed multiple market cycles are doing everything possible to acquire assets at their current valuations. The prevailing market conditions offer ridiculous financial opportunities for investors who understand market cycles.

Digital assets will rally again, and those who have accumulated during this phase will, without a doubt, walk away wealthy. Three essential picks ready to explode in 2023 are Uniglo.io, Monero, and Ethereum Classic.

Uniglo.io (GLO)

Uniglo is an easy choice to start the list. One of the very few genuinely bear-proof protocols and one that stands to gain tremendous value when the market reversal arrives. Uniglo leverages asset ownership and deflationary tokenomics to provide a long-term store of value. Hence, the bear market enhances its value proposition as investors look for a secure place to lock their funds.

Uniglo purchases and stores a unique mixture of assets in its protocol vault. These assets make GLO value-backed and lay the foundation for its price explosion. The developers behind the project understand market cycles; they are purchasing assets at depressed valuations. And when their value rallies in the bull market, the floor price of GLO will move violently to the upside. An excellent bear market choice and a protocol laden with potential.





Monero (XMR)

Monero was launched in 2014 and allowed participants to make anonymous transactions. Demand for XMR continues to swell as governments globally ramp up regulation and more centralized exchanges mandate KYC (Know Your Customer). Monero obscures its transactions through advanced cryptography and remains one of the few projects enabling anonymous market interactions.

As privacy concerns sharpen, Monero’s value proposition grows. Making it another excellent bear market pick and a token set to explode as regulations become increasingly stringent.

Ethereum Classic (ETC)

Ethereum Classic retains the original Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism and the original Ethereum record before the blockchain was rolled back due to The DAO exploit. The demand for this hard fork of Ethereum quietly builds as Ethereum becomes increasingly centralized and regulated by government authorities. As Ethereum’s centralization advances, expect an increase in ETC demand and an explosion in price coming in 2023.

Closing Thoughts

The crypto space constantly changes, and more institutional money flows in than ever before. The coming bull run will be unlike any that has come before it, and the current prices may well represent investors’ last chance to accumulate a decent stack of crypto before smart money drives the prices out of reach.

2022-10-31 10:43:02.331659,Cryptopolitan,"Undervalued Crypto: Get BudBlockz, Ethereum, and Solana at a Cheap Price","Cryptocurrencies have taken a significant beating, with valuation plunging to levels not seen in more than a year. Ethereum and Solana are some established projects that have shed more than 60% in market value year-to-date as the overall sector remains under pressure. On the other hand, BudBlockz is a new project trading at a discount despite offering exposure to some of the fastest-growing sectors.

BudBlockz Trading at a Discount

BudBlockz is poised to be the fastest-growing token, given the tremendous opportunities around the multi-billion cannabis industry. While 27 American states have decriminalized cannabis use, the number will continue to rise as other countries do, a move expected to make the cannabis industry worth more than $200 billion.

BudBlockz has developed arguably the biggest decentralized marketplace for cannabis. The marketplace will make it easy for people to buy and sell medical cannabis in a decentralized manner. Consequently, it should give rise to one of the biggest communities of cannabis enthusiasts.

$BLUNT, the native token powering BudBlockz , is trading at a big discount in the ongoing pre-sale. As the need for decentralized e-commerce solutions for the cannabis industry grows, $BLUNT would elicit strong demand, given its fast-mover market advantage. Early investors stand to earn handsome returns as the $BLUNT token power the first cannabis marketplace offering greater transparency.

Ethereum

Ethereum is down by about 60% year-to-date, making it one of the most undervalued crypto projects amid the current economic landscape. However, amid the steep sell-off, the projects’ long-term prospects remain intact as its blockchain elicits strong demand and use cases.

Ethereum is the preferred blockchain for developing decentralized applications that perform various functions and operations in multiple sectors. Additionally, it is the go-to platform for developing and deploying smart contracts.

Also, Ethereum is home to the greatest selection of decentralized finance applications, projects,metaverse and web3 projects. The immense utility and use case has triggered massive demand for the native ETH token.

Consequently, Ethereum is one project poised to bounce back and generate significant value once the overall sector bottoms out from the current deep correction. With the coin trading at about $1500, it is trading at a great discount considering the massive upside potential.

Solana

Solana is another crypto project that has felt the full brunt of the broader market correction. An 80% year-to-date correction means the cryptocurrency is trading at a discount going by its prospects as one of the fastest-growing smart contract platforms. In addition, the project is expanding its ecosystem by onboarding more programs and protocols.

Considering an alternative to Ethereum, Solana has positioned itself as a preferred smart contract platform, having integrated all the technologies on offer at Ethereum. Its blockchain supports the development of decentralized applications, Non-Fungible Tokens, and metaverse projects. In addition, it is a key player in decentralized finance, supporting the development of decentralized exchanges.

The increased use case continues to affirm strong demand for the native Solana ADA token. While the token has lost significant value, the deep pullback is an opportunity to buy the token at a discount, given its prospects amid increased cryptocurrency adoption.

Bottom Line

Caution has gripped the investment world after double-digit correction and steep sell-offs. Nevertheless, bear markets present some of the best investment opportunities. Hence, Solana Ethereum and BudBlockz stand out as attractive investment play as they are trading at a discount after recent corrections.

Earlier, it served as a cheaper and more volatile alternative to Ethereum, which is the second largest crypto by market cap. ETC provided very similar features as Ethereum, with the only difference being that it was far more volatile, but tended to mimic ETH’s price action with some added volatility. Thus due to that, it provided good trading opportunities along the way.

And after analyzing data from multiple on-chain metrics, ranging from hashrates touching all-time-highs and a steadily increasing amount of ETC tokens being HODLed by the top 1% of ETC holders, we can conclude that Ethereum Classic’s metrics seem very optimistic as of now. Analysis of both technical factors and on-chain metrics indicate that this particular crypto is well poised to support any bullish breakout that may happen in the near future. Thus if we see a sustained broader market recovery in sentiment and price, Ethereum Classic would definitely be a good recovery candidate in such a situation.","Ethereum Classic has been a favorite for short term traders for quite some time.

Le Thanh, a self-proclaimed ‘King of VGA,’ showed a video on Facebook where a bored GPU seller was sitting there all day chasing the flies away.

A passerby on a scooter then stops with the GPUs weighed prior to the smartphone payment being made.

Demand for GPUs has significantly fallen following ethereum’s move to Proof of Stake (PoS) which removed miners.

No other blockchain network has been able to absorb them, with data for September already showing a 10% decline in GPU prices.

October is the first month that ethereum is fully PoS. Price data are not yet out, with Q3 earnings for AMD to be published tomorrow, while Nvidia is later in November.

Both however will cover the months when eth was still Proof of Work. It won’t be until Q4 data that we’ll see just what effect ethereum mining had on GPU prices.

Nonetheless, at locations close to production the effects are already being felt in a sign of overproduction.

The market may therefore start being flooded as that supply moves from local areas to more globally where GPUs by the kilo are unlikely but lower prices should be expected.","Demand for GPUs has fallen so much that they’re now selling by the kilo in Vietnam where traders report low demand.

Market Cap is described as the value of a publicly listed company. In most cases, it can be easily calculated by multiplying the share price by the number of outstanding shares.

Ethereum has joined Bitcoin (valued at valued at $399.42 billion) as the only other cryptocurrency in the top 50 most valuable assets with Bitcoin ranked 14th in the list, just above Walmart and below Visa.

Similarly, the price has increased by 25% in the last 2 weeks, and 21% in the last 1 month despite little price activity following its full transition to Proof of Stake on September 15, 2022, which introduced a new era for the smart contracts network.

The transition was the most significant change on the blockchain’s infrastructure since it was started in 2013 as it cut its energy consumption by almost 99.9% while also setting the stage for further efficiency improvements.

Still, a few days following the transition concerns emerged that 2 nodes were dominating the new POS network.

2022-10-31 09:43:02.399429,Bitcoinist,Meet Dogeliens – The Meme Coin Set To Be Even More Successful Than Decentraland and Shiba Inu,"The meme coins are coming and they mean business. It is no sooner that memes might be ranked among the top coins like Ethereum and Bitcoin. From being mere funny coins to becoming solution-oriented cryptos. In 2013, a meme coin like Dogecoin was first created to become cherished and preserved by fans. Doge the “internet meme” grew in community size and became popular in the crypto space.

However, in contrast to Bitcoin and Ethereum, meme coins are typically created as a tribute to a meme, an intriguing or humorous concept recorded in an image, clips, or other pieces of media.

Before now, the majority of meme coins seem not to provide clear use cases. However, this is starting to change as some meme coins, such as Dogeliens (DOGET), are also providing actual advantages and uses. Dogeliens (DOGET) aims to fulfill the hype of DOGE and Shiba Inu by adding utility to become relevant and an “always go-to” coin.

Dogeliens, The Master of Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Dogeliens seek to be referred to as utility meme coins. The DOGET currency is decentralized finance created to be useful and valuable by investors and holders. Its character is interwoven with that of Dogecoin as both are designed to be dog-themed coins.

Dogeliens is completely out for change with the idea of invading the Metaverse. In the hope of launching fresh games, innovative ideas for giving back and sharing, and informative material to help people on Earth better comprehend and appreciate the blockchain industry.

Dogecoin also adopts the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to bring about a democratic system of governance where members can vote and contribute to community decision-making. Part of its plans is to donate to charity. 3% of all its transactions within every month will be donated to charity organizations. As part of the game, holders, through their DOGET, will have the authority to vote for the organization of their choice.

Dogeliens platform aims to be educative, entertaining, and rewarding. While Peer-to-Peer transactions are accessible, DOGE promises to be much more profitable for investment. It seeks to grow wild on social media and become a more engaging topic. With its roadmap approach, DOGE might be worth holding.

Decentraland and the Future

The metaverse is growing into a multi-million investment. Virtual communities like Decentraland are getting stocked and ready for the massive demand.

The Decentraland ecosystem has been created to Meetup with the demand of the present. It is the first coin that was launched as a decentralized virtual community. With the use of its native token, MANA, users can purchase plots of land which can be held as an asset or developed into structures.

While pandemic crises like Covid-19 were a major threat to the economic and social gathering, the Decentraland community is a major remedy to keep businesses and organizations running. Decentraland might be much more profitable in the coming years.

Can Shiba Inu (SHIB) Cross $1?

Shiba Inu is one of the most well-known and actively traded cryptocurrencies in the crypto space. SHIB belongs to the doge-themed and belongs to the class of coins with massive community support.

But the question is, can SHIB jump to a dollar price? However, the trading volume for the second-largest meme token has been announced to surpass $100 million. This increase follows Google’s recent statement that it would collaborate with Coinbase to enable cryptocurrency as a means of payment for its cloud services

Also among the first cryptocurrencies to be accepted as payment was SHIB. As a result, after the announcement, its trading volume increased by over 20%.

2022-10-31 05:43:02.852661,The Herald,The most profitable cryptocurrency to buy in 2023,"Unlike traditional investment markets such as the s&p 500 and the nasdaq, the cryptocurrency arena has emerged as a burgeoning space in recent years. this is primarily due to the extreme returns many cryptocurrencies have generated over the past few years, outperforming even the stock market and other investment vehicles renowned for their stability and reliability. some of these cryptocurrencies include bitcoin, ethereum, and ripple, which already boasts a market cap of billions of dollars and continues to grow at an unprecedented pace.

By investing in cryptocurrencies today, individuals can gain access to a class of assets that could change the landscape of investment markets forever. whether one chooses to invest a small or significant sum, there is no denying that investing in cryptocurrency offers exciting opportunities for growth and profit that simply cannot be found elsewhere.

That said, the cryptocurrency market is more volatile than other markets and can have bear markets that can wipe out significant amounts of value. for instance, the 2022 cryptocurrency bear market has wiped out more than 70% off most cryptocurrencies. the good news is that this presents an opportunity to profit even more once the market rebounds.

If you want to maximize returns, here is the most profitable cryptocurrency to buy today.

A closer look at the most profitable cryptocurrencies to buy in 2023

The entire cryptocurrency is trading at massive lows. from a market capitalisation of close to $3 trillion towards the end of 2021, it is now hovering around $900 billion. Interestingly, most cryptocurrencies have experienced increased adoption and improved technical fundamentals despite dropping prices.

Anyone who chooses to buy cryptocurrencies at current prices could get a good return in 2023.

Below, we take an in-depth look at the top profitable cryptocurrencies to invest in 2023. Each has lots of potential due to a heavy price discount and fast-growing fundamentals.

Shiba inu

Shiba inu is a top meme coin that easily stands out as a profitable cryptocurrency to invest in.

Shiba inu entered the market in late 2020 and was designed to capitalise on the growing popularity of dogecoin and other meme coins. Though its creators initially conceived of it simply as a joke, shiba inu has continued to surprise and impress investors with its steady gains over the past year. It was one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in 2021, with gains of over 40 million per cent.

And with momentum on its side, shiba inu shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. For instance, the shiba inu team has launched a layer-2 solution to make shib scale better, a metaverse, and pay and burn feature to cut down on the number of tokens in circulation.

With these developments, a growing community and shiba inu is trading at a massive discount from its most recent highs. This is coupled with the fact that shiba inu is now available on most top cryptocurrency exchanges like etoro. in another rally, shiba inu stands out as a highly profitable cryptocurrency to buy in 2023.

Chainlink

Chainlink is one of the most obvious inclusions in the list of top-performing cryptocurrencies to buy in 2023. That's because, in terms of its fundamentals, chainlink ranks among the top leading cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum. chainlink has a lot of similarities to bitcoin that give it a high potential to go up in value long term.

For instance, just like bitcoin, chainlink has market dominance. While bitcoin dominates the entire market, chainlink has built dominance in the decentralised oracles market. It controls more than 60 per cent of this market, and almost all the major smart contract chains use chainlink data oracles for their smart contracts. This means there is very little chance that chainlink will ever lose its market dominance.

The odds are that chainlink is hugely undervalued at current prices thanks to such strong fundamentals. Since it made all-time highs in 2021, chainlink has lost a significant portion of its value – more than 75 per cent off its most recent all-time highs.

Going into 2023, chainlink has a good chance of being a profitable cryptocurrency for exponential gains due to the upcoming staking feature. While it has not yet been introduced, there is speculation that chainlink staking will become a thing soon. Once it is introduced, we could see the number of people who opt to buy chainlink increase in anticipation of the passive income that will come with staking. Essentially, a lot going on could see chainlink emerge as one of the top cryptocurrency performers. The odds favour link.

Sandbox

The metaverse is growing, and sandbox is one of the top metaverse cryptocurrencies in the market today. This makes it an easy pick for the top profitable cryptocurrency to invest in 2023. Sandbox has a lot going for it, making it a good metaverse cryptocurrency to buy.

For instance, there is growing adoption of the sandbox relative to most other metaverse cryptocurrencies. For instance, in 2022, sandbox inked a deal with warner music for virtual concerts to start taking place on the sandbox metaverse. At the same time, top musicians have started performing on the sandbox metaverse, including Snoop Dogg.

With such high-profile adoption, sandbox will likely draw more money relative to other metaverse cryptocurrencies going into the future. Sandbox and other top cryptocurrencies also stand to benefit from the fact that governments are increasingly making regulations and investments that favour this market.

For instance, the governments of South Korea and Japan have made considerable investments to ensure that the metaverse takes off in their countries. This means there is a lot of hope for cryptocurrencies like sandbox to do well going into the future.

The best part is that sandbox is currently trading at a huge discount from its all-time highs in 2021. If it retests its most recent all-time highs, sandbox would give investors an roi of over 200 per cent. This would make it one of the top most profitable cryptocurrencies to buy today.

While there are no guarantees in the cryptocurrency market, the odds clearly favor sandbox in the short to medium term.

Cardano

Cardano is one of the most technically advanced cryptocurrencies in the market today. As such, it stands out as a profitable cryptocurrency to invest in right now.

One of the key factors that makes cardano a good cryptocurrency to buy is that its proof-of-stake algorithm is one of the best in the market. Even ethereum, which recently transitioned to proof-of-stake, can't match cardano in terms of efficiency.

Cardano's proof-of-stake algorithm is decentralised, scalable, and secure. it can maintain a balance between these three key aspects of the blockchain even as network adoption grows.

Besides its technical capabilities, cardano adoption points to a cryptocurrency that is on a growth trajectory. for instance, since the introduction of cardano smart contracts back in 2021, network adoption has grown. Even metaverse projects are now building on cardano. This is a pointer to the long-term growth of cardano in the long run.

At the same time, cardano's price prediction action points to a potential for growth in the short to medium term. That's because cardano is currently trading at massive lows, off more than 70 per cent its most recent high, and is currently trading at under $0.50. If cardano were to retest all-time highs again, then cardano would give investors a return of over 200 per cent.

Avalanche

Avalanche stands out among the top-performing cryptocurrencies to buy today. Avalanche makes it to this list for its capabilities as a stable and highly scalable platform blockchain.

Thanks to its abilities, avalanche now has one of the fastest ecosystems of projects building on top of it. From defi to nfts, avalanche has emerged as one of the most credible defi cryptocurrencies in the market today.

Besides its growing strengths as an ethereum competitor in the smart contracts market, avalanche is currently trading at record lows from its 2021 highs. Avalanche is trading at under $20, down from highs of over $100 back in 2021.

This means if avalanche were to just return to its all-time highs, it would give investors a return of over 300 per cent from its most recent highs. This is a potentially high return and from a cryptocurrency that also has some pretty good prospects long term.

Polygon

Next on the list of top most profitable cryptocurrencies to buy and hold is polygon. Polygon is the largest ethereum layer-2 chain and already has a large and fast-growing ecosystem of cryptocurrencies building on top of it.

Besides its position as a top ethereum layer-2, polygon's tokenomics make it a top profitable cryptocurrency to buy now. Since mid-2022, polygon has become deflationary, which means the more it is adopted, demand will drive up the price due to the basic economics of demand and supply.

Even with all these fundamentals in favor of polygon's growth, polygon is currently trading at a significant discount compared to its 2021 highs. At its current price, polygon has the potential to give investors a return of over 200 per cent if it retests its most recent all-time highs.

With the odds that the cryptocurrency market could now be trading at the bottom or is very close to it, polygon's potential value in 2023 is pretty high. You will also love that polygon is available on almost all top cryptocurrency exchanges, including etoro.

Cosmos

Next in the list of top cryptocurrencies to invest in right now is cosmos. Cosmos entered the market in 2019 to solve the problem of blockchain interoperability. This concept refers to the ability of two or more blockchains to communicate and share data, even though their underlying networks utilise different coding languages and consensus algorithms.

By enabling interoperability between a wide range of blockchains, cosmos has revolutionised the way we think about distributed systems and peer-to-peer networks. Their ultimate vision is one where any blockchain can interoperate with any other blockchain to support new use cases and create innovative applications.

Whether you are a developer looking for an easier way to integrate blockchain into your projects or someone interested in learning more about this emerging technology, cosmos is sure to be at the forefront of your mind. With its roots firmly planted in innovation and progress, this platform will undoubtedly pave new paths on the road ahead for many years to come.

Cosmos has the potential to open up new avenues for collaboration, paving the way for the development of what some have dubbed web 3.0 – an interconnected web of decentralised online services underpinned by blockchain technology. whether or not cosmos ultimately succeeds in this ambitious endeavor remains to be seen, but it has already sparked much excitement within the blockchain community, heralding a powerful shift in how we think about data sharing and exchange.

Currently, cosmos is trading at more than 70 per cent off its recent all-time highs. With adoption on a growth trajectory, the odds are that cosmos value will increase over time, especially if bulls return to the market. This makes cosmos one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy and hold with a potential for exponential gains.

Ethereum – platform blockchain with massive potential due to improving fundamentals

There are many options to choose from when it comes to investing in cryptocurrencies. Some are still in the early stages of development, while others have already established themselves as industry leaders. One cryptocurrency that is well-established yet still holds impressive growth potential is ethereum.

Not only does this digital currency currently boast a multi-billion-dollar market capitalisation, but its value has continued to rise steadily in recent years. To understand why ethereum is a profitable cryptocurrency to buy, consider its price action since its launch. When ethereum conducted an initial coin offering (ico) back in 2014, it was selling at under a dollar. Today, it is worth over $1000, meaning that anyone who invested at that time could have seen a several hundred percent return on their investment today.

With the recent shift to proof-of-stake, ethereum is a good buy today as it is set to gain even more traction. That's because ethereum is now deflationary and is set to scale even better and with a lower impact on the environment. So now might be the perfect time to get involved with ethereum, as it has what it takes to be one of the most profitable cryptocurrencies to buy in 2023.

To get an idea of how good of an investment ethereum is today, consider that it seems to have found support at the $1000 level. This means if it were to raise in 2023 and retest it's all-time highs, ethereum price prediction could give investors a return of over 200 per cent.

Dogecoin – number one meme coin with a fast-growing community.

Hype is one of the biggest factors regarding cryptocurrency value appreciation. This was most evident during the 2021 bull market when the most hype cryptocurrencies were the best performers. For this reason, dogecoin makes it to the list of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in 2023.

Dogecoin was launched at a time when the concept of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology were just beginning to gain mainstream recognition. Launched in early 2013, dogecoin quickly became one of the most established tokens in this rapidly growing market. At its launch, dogecoin was trading for just $0.0002 per token, but this soon skyrocketed as its popularity grew and more people began to take an interest in this groundbreaking new technology.

The rise of dogecoin would not have been possible without the support of elon musk. As CEO of Tesla, Musk is known for his forward-thinking ideas about technology and business. In early 2021, he expressed his admiration for dogecoin through positive tweets about the project. These tweets not only sparked a wave of new interest in this cryptocurrency, but also prompted speculation that Musk himself might be involved with the development of dogecoin or other related projects. Whatever the case may be, this endorsement from such a powerful figure helped to solidify dogecoin's place as one of the most prominent cryptocurrencies on the market. Thanks to this combination of longevity and enthusiastic support from influential figures like Musk, dogecoin continues to prosper today and seems poised for continued success well into the future.

The Musk effect was so high that by May 2021, dogecoin was trading at $0.77. while Musk may not be such an influential figure on dogecoin anymore, his tweets opened dogecoin to more adoption and community growth.

Now that dogecoin is over 80 per cent off its 2021 highs, this large and growing community could see dogecoin rally in 2023. If dogecoin rallies from its current price, it could easily do 4x from its current price. That's why it stands out among the top most profitable cryptocurrencies.

Defi coin – new high-growth defi cryptocurrency with high yields and token swaps.

Decentralised finance is on a growth trajectory despite the slump in cryptocurrency prices in 2022. For this reason, next-gen defi cryptocurrencies like defi coin are in a unique place for growth going into the future. That's why at current prices, defi coin makes it to the list of most profitable cryptocurrencies to buy in 2023.

Defi coin is taking the defi market by storm. Led by a highly qualified and experienced team of developers, defi is focused on creating an innovative platform that is fully secure and reliable in all areas.

One exciting development for defi coin is the upcoming launch of the defi swap exchange. The team behind this innovative platform has been working tirelessly on the final stages of its development, and it looks like everything is on target for a seamless launch. With defi swap, users can buy and sell tokens without going through a third party or opening an account. Furthermore, transactions are carried out anonymously using smart contracts, which ensure timely, secure execution of all trades. given these features, now could be a good time to buy defi coin before defi swap officially launches.

Besides being a relatively new cryptocurrency, defi coin is likely to keep drawing in investors looking for exponential gains once the markets gain traction. New cryptocurrencies tend to do well when fomo hits the market, which means defi coin stands out as one of the top profitable cryptocurrencies to invest in 2023.

Bitcoin – most adopted cryptocurrency with huge potential as supply dwindles.

Bitcoin is one of the market's most stable and profitable cryptocurrencies today. Despite multiple bull and bear cycles, a smoothed curve for bitcoin shows that it has been on an upward trajectory since it launched.

When bitcoin was first introduced in 2009, very few people knew about cryptographic currencies. This gave early investors a chance to buy bitcoin at extremely low prices. It was relatively easy to obtain bitcoin simply by connecting a basic gpu to your desktop computer.

Things have changed over the years though. By late 2021, bitcoin was trading highs of $69k. However, following bitcoin's high point in late 2021, its value dropped significantly to lows near $19,000. Despite this fluctuation, however, there is no doubt that the unprecedented growth witnessed by bitcoin since its inception is a powerful testament to the compelling nature of this emerging technology.

At current prices, even if bitcoin were just to retest its most recent highs, it would give investors an incredible return on investment. Potentially up to 2x its current value.

The indicators are that bitcoin is a top cryptocurrency to consider adding to your watchlists in 2023. For starters, adoption is on a growth trajectory. For instance, despite the bear market, the number of institutional investors taking up bitcoin is on a growth trajectory. Given that bitcoin has a hard-capped supply of only 21 million coins, this growing investment signals bitcoin's viability as a cryptocurrency to buy.

Decentraland – metaverse cryptocurrency with a fast-growing gaming ecosystem

Decentraland is one of the best metaverse cryptocurrencies in the market today. This means that having dropped more than 70 per cent off its most recent all-time highs, there is a huge opportunity for gains.

Decentraland is a virtual world unlike any other. Built on top of the ethereum blockchain, it allows users to freely explore its vast expanse, commune with other residents, and interact with an infinite array of digital content. Unlike many other virtual worlds, decentraland holds tremendous potential for developers who want to build immersive 3d experiences.

As a decentralised platform that places content ownership in the hands of users, decentraland enables creators to easily deploy dynamic and interactive digital spaces that seamlessly blend the physical and digital worlds. With thousands of prospects for innovation and limitless opportunities for interaction and enrichment, decentraland presents a bold glimpse into the future of the metaverse.

The best part is that users' virtual assets on the decentraland can be sold as nfts. Users can then store nfts in a cryptocurrency exchange of their choice or sell them. With nfts expected to gain traction going into the future, decentraland stands out as a top cryptocurrency to invest in.

How we identify profitable cryptocurrencies to invest in today

Since the bear market began, most cryptocurrencies have lost significant value and seen widespread price fluctuations. While this may seem scary to many investors, it is important to remember that these fluctuations are normal in the volatile world of cryptos. That's why deciding on potentially profitable cryptocurrencies to invest in can be a challenging endeavor. Many factors must be considered, including a cryptocurrency's technical foundations, potential use cases, and long-term viability.

Additionally, investors must often navigate confusing or contradictory information from nascent crypto communities and must stay up-to-date with the latest developments in this rapidly evolving market. Ultimately, successfully navigating through all of these challenges will require patience and a deep understanding of the cryptocurrency space as a whole. But for those who can successfully navigate these rough waters, investing in good crypto projects has the potential to yield tremendous rewards.

You don't have to worry though. In the section below, we take through the procedure we have taken to choose the most profitable cryptocurrency to invest in 2023. You can use the same techniques to choose high-potential cryptocurrencies you can invest in going into the future.

Consider the idea behind the cryptocurrency and its roadmap

When looking for the best cryptocurrency to invest in, one of the most important factors is the underlying concept and vision behind the project. This includes not only understanding what problem the project aims to address, but also evaluating how realistic its goals and targets are. A good indicator of a promising project is a clear, well-developed roadmap outlining specific goals that are designed to be achieved within a set period.

Another critical step is to thoroughly research the technical details of each potential investment, as this can help determine which projects have strong development teams with significant experience in blockchain technology. In short, when searching for the most profitable cryptocurrency, it is crucial to go beyond simple token performance metrics and look at everything from concept and roadmap targets to technological viability and team experience.

For instance, ethereum has been such a huge success because the idea of creating a decentralised world computer was powerful. Similarly, if you use the same approach to scout for cryptocurrencies, you are likely to find a profitable cryptocurrency to buy in 2023.

Look for hugely undervalued and fundamentally strong cryptocurrencies

One of the best ways to find profitable cryptocurrencies is to look for fundamentally strong cryptocurrencies that have seen a huge drop in valuation. During market downturns like the one we are experiencing now, many cryptocurrencies lose significant value as investors bail out and cash out their positions.

By looking for promising coins that have experienced significant losses, you can often get in on these projects at discounted rates and potentially reap big gains when their valuations eventually rise again. Some key factors to consider when researching potential investments include the project's active development community, future roadmap milestones, and overall popularity among crypto enthusiasts. With time, patience, and a bit of luck, choosing good picks from the sea of struggling cryptocurrencies could lead to profitability.

For instance, bitcoin is without a doubt one of the fundamentally strongest cryptocurrencies in the market today. An investor can record huge profits by capitalising on its ups and downs. After the crash of 2018, bitcoin dropped from over $20k to a low of $3000. Investors that capitalised on this dip benefited immensely when bitcoin hit a high of $69,000 in 2021.

Similarly, by buying bitcoin at its current lows of under $20k, it could emerge as a top profitable cryptocurrency in 2023, even by just retesting its most recent highs.

Consider the token distribution

There is no denying the fact that investing in cryptocurrency can be a profitable venture. However, finding the right coin to invest in isn't always easy. One effective way to identify profitable cryptocurrencies is to assess the number of people who hold the token in question. A high holder count indicates that many people have an interest in that particular coin and its potential for growth. Therefore, by focusing on tokens with high holder counts, investors can increase their chances of finding profitable investments and outperforming the market as a whole.

In most cases, cryptocurrencies, where all the coins are concentrated in only a few wallets, tend to be pump-and-dump schemes or even outright scams. That's because the few accounts that hold all the tokens have a lot of influence on what happens to the cryptocurrency.

Consider its price action in previous bear markets

Many of the most popular cryptocurrencies today are relatively new, having launched in the past few years. These up-and-coming projects tend to experience rapid growth in price and user base, but they also face an increased risk of adversely affecting a bear market.

On the other hand, older cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, dogecoin, and ethereum have already endured multiple bear markets to date, making them somewhat more resilient to total collapse even after market downturns. By virtue of their longevity and proven track record, these cryptocurrencies may be considered less risky investments and thus better positioned for long-term growth.

Furthermore, their numerous use cases and strong community support also recommend them as solid investment opportunities for those looking to capitalise on the continued momentum of this exciting new technology. in short, while new cryptocurrencies may offer higher returns in good times, experienced projects like bitcoin offer greater stability in the long run.

As such, if you are looking for a profitable cryptocurrency to invest in right now that is also relatively safe, it is important to consider past price action.

When is the best time to buy profitable cryptocurrencies?

Buy during bear markets

When it comes to investing in cryptocurrencies, timing is everything. During extended bear market conditions, some of the best opportunities to buy can be found in top digital currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum. These tokens often trade at steeply discounted prices during these downtrends, and those that bought in early have been able to enjoy enormous profits when prices eventually recover.

Additionally, major regulatory developments tend to occur during these times of uncertainty, which creates new opportunities for investors who are poised and ready to take action. So, if you're looking for profitable cryptocurrencies to buy in 2023, the current bear market conditions are the perfect time to start buying.

As long as you stay calm, patient, and strategic with your investments, there's no reason why you can't profit from this exciting and ever-changing market explosion.

Buy during presales

There are many different strategies for buying cryptocurrencies, and one of the most effective is participating in the presale of a new token. Unlike buying during a coin's public offering, where prices may be driven up by speculation and hype, participating in a project's presale typically offers a much more favorable price point. This is because investors who buy during the presale are taking on greater risk since they are helping the team raise the capital they need to launch their project.

In addition, those who buy early often have the opportunity to earn bonus tokens or extra rewards if they agree to lock their investment into their wallet for some time after the sale has concluded. Overall, purchasing coins during a project's presale can be an excellent way to invest in promising cryptocurrencies and potentially reap great returns over time.

Just to give you an idea of how big presales can be, consider that in its ico, ethereum was trading at $0.30. Ethereum has since become one of the most profitable cryptocurrencies ever, even hitting a high of $4800 in 2022.

On the occasion of Meta completing one year on the rebrand, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the CEO of the crypto exchange FTX, shared his thoughts on the rebranding and what it means for the future of Meta.

Zuckerberg’s $100 billion Metaverse experiment first raised eyebrows when the CEO released the avatar for Meta’s Horizon Worlds VR platform. Subsequent releases of the Zuckerberg avatar fell prey to internet memes, although each new iteration seemed visually better than its predecessor.

According to Bankman-Fried, Facebook’s growth was not impacted by newer rivals such as TikTok. Rather, he argued that the company “stopped growing because, well, there was no more room to grow.”

SBF suspected that rebranding to Meta was a way for Facebook to improve its reputation through distraction. Moreover, the move would strengthen Meta’s narrative for generating high income upon its success.

However, SBF highlighted “the vague Meta guidance” and how the investors have decided to spend $10 billion per year in the metaverse. The intent to infuse $10 billion yearly strengthens Zuckerberg’s position as a believer in the metaverse.

On an end note, SBF reiterated that Facebook had already won by becoming the largest social media network. “So what's next? Start building Social Media 3.0,” concluded SBF.

2022-10-31 06:43:02.880142,The Coin Republic,A Deep Dive into Dogeliens,"Dogeliens is a DeFi technology created on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The utility meme currency DOGET powers it. DOGET is a BEP-20 coin that may be traded on any BSC DEX bridge or protocol.

A well-known DEX, such as PancakeSwap, is an example of a hand-picked DEX bridge that will allow for the immediate purchase and sale of the DOGET token in exchange for other BSC (BEP-20) tokens.

Dogeliens (DOGET) will include a metaverse, allowing it to compete in the Web3 market. This guide introduces you to the Dogeliens protocol, its native currency, DOGET, and some critical principles to remember as you explore and utilize Dogeliens.

Features of the Dogeliens Ecosystem

There is more to Dogeliens than meets the eye. Some of the most essential elements or characteristics of the Dogeliens Ecosystem are listed below. Puptopia, a play-to-earn GameFi Metaverse with exciting features and prizes, is a virtual environment created by Dogeliens. Puptopia is a stylized rendition of Dogeliens’ name or subject and is a member of the Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) meme family.

The primary movers in Puptopia will be DOGET and NFTs. This strategy applies to all future Web3 protocols. Utility NFTs may be bought and sold in the Metaverse thanks to DOGET, which will facilitate this activity.

NFTs on Dogeliens’ Metaverse may be auctioned and exchanged on other NFT exchanges thanks to a cross-chain interoperability mechanism. However, this hasn’t been formally confirmed as of the writing of this sentence.

As was already indicated, the NFT market is another essential part of the Dogeliens Ecosystem. Simple NFT trading is encouraged by NFT marketplaces. As Dogeliens expands and gains speed in the DeFi region, its NFT market may eventually feature expensive collectibles.

Selling Metaverse assets requires a strong NFT market. The NFT marketplace will be powered by Binance and DOGET, a BEP-20 token that is an ecosystem component.

The token economics (tokenomics) of any DeFi protocol lets you examine the asset market value and identify the prospective tokens that could be available at any given moment.

A total of 25 billion DOGET tokens will be produced, and they will be distributed as follows: 30% for the presale, 35% for the creation of the metaverse, 15% for education, and 20% for liquidity maintenance.

Which Blockchain Network Hosts Dogeliens (DOGET)?

The Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network, which also establishes DOGET’s token standard, BEP-20, is responsible for hosting the Dogeliens ecosystem. As a result, you must use a DEX or cryptocurrency exchange that supports both DOGET and BSC tokens to swap or trade the coins conveniently.

Do Dogeliens Undergo Audits?

As of the time of writing, Dogeliens was still being evaluated to ensure it complied with the standards of the DeFi sector. At this point, using the system is totally at your own risk. You must use the site carefully or hold off until it has undergone a rigorous audit before partaking in fun!

Are Ethereum Tokens Accepted by Dogeliens (DOGET)?

Dogeliens do not accept Ethereum and NFT tokens. Additionally, as of this writing, there are no plans to permit Ethereum-based assets on its network. As a result, since Dogelien is a Binance-based (BEP) protocol, you cannot swap or exchange Ethereum (ERC) assets for those of Dogelien.

Where Am I Able to Buy DOGET?

The native cryptocurrency and meme token of Dogeliens, DOGET, is available for purchase through PancakeSwap’s private sale (presale) or open sale (IDO). It would be best if you got started with a compatible Wallet, such as Trust Wallet or Metamask Wallet.

Here’s a new project with massive potential and user-friendly features. Click the links below to join the Dogeliens ecosystem today.

Competition among new cryptocurrency projects is tough. That’s why it’s an awesome feat when one of them breaks out to show a strong growth potential right off the bat. This is precisely what Oryen (ORY) is doing. This new project has already doubled the worth of investments for the people who bought the ORY token early. Oryen is rising quickly, putting the market positions of Compound (COMP) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) into question.

Oryen (ORY) and its promise of fixed returns

Oryen is a reserve currency that allows you to invest, stake, and establish a passive income source to support your future. Investors do not need to fear missing out on profits because of the Oryen Autostaking Technic (OAT) system and the rebase reward system that gives prizes to token holders every 60 minutes. Everything happens inside the investor’s wallet, making staking and earning very simple and easy. This also means that your tokens and wallet are both safe and your investment is always in the green zone.

With ORY, investors receive a 90% annual percentage yield (APY) or a daily return on investment (ROI) of 0.177%. These figures go beyond what other tokens can offer. Further, the APY is stable, unaffected by the fluctuations of the market. A treasury and the Risk-Free Value (RFV), which is a protocol-owned wallet that holds a buffer value, ensure the stability of the floor price.

The project is attracting many analysts and investors. Popular crypto enthusiast, Darryl Boo, recently spoke about the project on his YouTube channel. This high level of attention has helped drive up the price of ORY. Those who bought the token during the first presale weeks are now seeing their investment double. Experts also see more growth in store for ORY.

Compound (COMP)

At this rate, ORY could overcome Compound (COMP) in the Top 100 crypto list. Compound (COMP) is an Ethereum-based decentralized lending platform that allows users to supply and borrow Ethereum tokens at variable interest rates. It is programmed to match lenders and borrowers algorithmically without a middleman. Compound introduced the concept of “liquidity mining"", which rewards users for lending their cryptocurrency. Token holders can also earn more by farming, which refers to looking for potential borrowers that would give the largest return.

Ethereum Name Service (ENS)

Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is another project the ORY could knock out of the Top 100 list. This project converts the long string of code representing Ethereum addresses, metadata, and content hashes into human-readable names, which are easier to remember. People and dApps can then easily share crypto addresses, making the emerging Web 3.0 ecosystem more convenient and marketable to common users.

The bottom line

Oryen (ORY) has already achieved a 100% profit for early backers of its token. With the protocol’s special mix of features, we expect more buyers to flock to Oryen’s presale and more growth to come out of the project.

2022-10-31 09:43:02.884449,MakeUseOf,The 5 Best Crypto IRAs to Use for Your Retirement,"One eye on the future? Everyone should, really.

Cryptocurrencies are available to a wide range of investors, and there are now several ways to invest.

One such option is a Bitcoin IRA, which allows investors to buy and trade the asset using an established IRA platform ahead of their retirement. The following are the best crypto IRAs you can use to invest in Bitcoin against your retirement.

MakeUseOf Video of the Day

1. BitcoinIRA

BitcoinIRA is by far the most popular crypto IRA available. You can trade on the platform 24/7, making it possible to trade whenever you wish.

BitcoinIRA supports over 60 crypto assets, including Bitcoin, of course, and many top altcoins, such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and Cardano.

With just $3,000, you can open an IRA account and buy and start trading a single cryptocurrency or multiple cryptocurrencies of any combination.

You can also roll over other retirement funds such as traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, SEP IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs, 403b, or 401k into your BitcoinIRA account and keep trading.

BitcoinIRA works with crypto custodial services provider, BitGo to securely hold your crypto assets in offline cold storage, making it safe from attackers even if the platform is compromised.

What's more? A $700 million insurance policy covers your retirement investment should anything go wrong.

Apart from a one-time fee used to cover security, storage, and other costs, there are specific fees that BitcoinIRA doesn't state explicitly. You'll need to speak with an agent to get specific numbers, depending on how you want to structure your account.

2. BitIRA

BitIRA is one of the top crypto IRAs you should consider before retirement. Like BitcoinIRA, it supports several crypto assets for you to choose from, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.

You'll need a minimum of $5,000 to invest in this one, and you can invest in any number of the supported crypto assets. BitIRA's fees include $195 for annual maintenance, 0.05% of invested amount as a custody fee, and a one-time $50 setup fee, in addition to variable transaction fees.

For security, BitIRA employs cold storage with Equity Trust Company to securely provide custody for users' funds while giving them complete control of their assets. There's also a $100 million insurance cover for your funds in case of any misfortunes.

3. CoinIRA

CoinIRA provides a platform for investing in a single or multiple cryptocurrencies. It supports at least 20 assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Supported accounts include traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, SEP IRAs, and SIMPLE IRAs.

One thing that sets CoinIRA apart is that in addition to its crypto assets, it also provides a crypto IRA guide to help you better understand your investment. They also provide consultants to help answer any questions concerning your investment.

Also noteworthy is the fact that CoinIRA doesn't charge custody fees, even though Equity Trust Company is its crypto custodian, just like BitIRA. Instead, you'll need to pay a 1.25% buy transaction fee and a 1% sell transaction fee when trading.

There is no startup or maintenance fee, but the minimum initial investment is $5,000, which may be on the high side for some investors.

4. Regal Assets

Regal Assets is known for providing variety for its IRA account holders. Apart from cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin (and many others, with 22 in total), it also provides hard assets such as gold and silver.

Regal Assets started initially as a platform purely dedicated to precious metals. It only included cryptocurrencies in 2017, when the demand for cryptocurrencies started to soar.

Like the other IRA platforms, it uses offline storage to secure customers' assets, for which you'll pay $150 yearly for the storage and a $100 annual administrative fee.

You can sign up on Regal Assets and start with an initial investment or rollover your traditional IRA account into it. If your favorite crypto asset isn't among the listed 22, Regal Assets has an on-demand request for such a situation, and you can call to make a special request.

The major downside of this platform are the huge fees it charges for account maintenance and administration, but you can enjoy the variety that only a few platforms like it offer.

5. iTrustCapital

iTrustCapital is a reputable platform for crypto IRA investing and one that is more affordable than most. The platform is friendly towards both beginners and experienced investors alike, giving everyone a chance to experiment with a crypto IRA account.

If you're just starting out in crypto investing, it may be helpful to research which altcoins to invest in first.

With a minimum investment of just $1,000, iTrustCapital lowers the bar for crypto IRA investing for retirement to those with lower capital. Like Regal Assets, you can buy and trade crypto and hard assets, such as gold and silver, in real-time, using your retirement account on iTrustCapital.

There are over 25 cryptocurrencies to choose from, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins that you can trade at any time of the day, 24/7. There are no monthly or annual account maintenance fees, and the transaction fee for crypto is 1% flat. The transaction fee for gold is $50 per ounce, while silver is $2.50 per ounce.

Assets on iTrustCapital are covered with insurance of up to $370 million in collaboration with Coinbase Custody, the custodial services arm of Coinbase, one of America's best crypto exchanges.

The downside is that you can only fund your account with USD before buying crypto, as direct funding with crypto from another wallet is not allowed.

If you're looking for a low-cost platform to start your crypto IRA with just $1,000 and access digital and hard assets at an affordable cost, iTrustCapital may be the place for you.

Which BitcoinIRA Suits You?

These are the top crypto IRA platforms you can use to invest in crypto for your retirement. Depending on your needs, any of them may suit you, and you should choose based on what you wish to achieve.

For example, If you're looking for a combination of asset diversity and low fees, iTrustCapital is the choice. There are other factors that may come into play to decide which platform you choose ultimately, but be sure it is capable of helping you achieve your IRA crypto investment goals.","The following are the best crypto IRAs you can use to invest in Bitcoin against your retirement.

2022-10-30 11:43:02.918697,NewsBTC,Find out how Snowfall Protocol is outshining Minifootball and EverETH!,"Do you want to maximize earnings from your investment? If so, Snowfall Protocol (SNW),

Minifootball (MINIFOOTBALL) and EverETH (EVERETH) are the tokens you should look at! Market experts have identified these tokens as having the maximum ROI potential.

Minifootball (MINIFOOTBALL)

One of the most popular trends in cryptocurrency over the past two years or more has been theme coins, specifically meme coins. These tokens are tributes to DOGE, the crypto that launched as a parody of the first crypto boom.

Regardless of the origin, there are a lot of coins competing with one another. There’s a lot of debate on the utility of those tokens. But there are enough of them to become an entire segment of cryptocurrency.

Minifootball (MINIFOOTBALL) is also a meme token. This coin is designed to appeal to a combination of dog coins and football fans. The system is designed so that platform members can participate in competitions, like weekly FIFA game tournaments, through a Discord server. Once again, it is a fun theme and game coin with little value to add to crypto concerns, unlike the revolutionary Snowfall Protocol (SNW).

EverETH (EVERETH)

One of the biggest coins in cryptocurrency is Ethereum (ETH), the native coin of Ethereum (ETH).

What drives the value of Ethereum (ETH) is the concept of decentralized finance or DeFi.

The DeFi sector is becoming as popular as crypto and growing as fast as crypto. As Ethereum (ETH) slows and lags under the heavy users it has attracted, other technologies and chains are looking to catch up and challenge it for its efficiency and pricing.

EVERETH is the native token of the EverETH blockchain. Investors in this cryptocurrency can (in theory, at least) earn Ethereum (ETH) just by holding EVERETH.

Snowfall Protocol (SNW)

Snowfall Protocol (SNW) addresses the problems that investors face in one of cryptocurrency’s most popular features. This is liquidity or yield farming. This process rewards users for finding a decentralized finance (DeFi) network for their capital to multiply.

This helped raise the demand for cross-chain functionality to support all key crypto chains. Cross-chain allows users to make transactions across different chains and lets smart contracts move from one crypto chain to another when needed. This would let DeFi platforms work better and more efficiently than on a single chain.

Snowfall Protocol (SNW) is important because it allows different blockchains to communicate with each other. This is an important development because it helps to facilitate the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Snowfall Protocol (SNW) offers a most welcome opportunity for users on blockchains to earn money through liquidity farming on multiple chains to earn more or to expand their portfolios.

Snowfall Protocol (SNW) has seen a rise of 30% at the start of its presale stage because of its unique co-operability model. Some experts think Snowfall Protocol could grow 5000% by its launch as it solves a major problem in the cryptocurrency space: the lack of cooperation between different blockchains. This sets it up to see bursts in its demand as it launches.

At time of writing, Snowfall Protocol (SNW) is trading at just $0.009 and is expected to grow 1000X as top market analysts are extremely bullish on this coin.

,Crypto News,Top 7 Decentralized Derivatives Trading Platforms,"Top 7 Decentralized Derivatives Trading Platforms

Decentralized derivatives are a new way for traders to trade crypto assets without directly holding them.

Read on to learn what decentralized crypto derivatives are and where you can trade them.

What Are Decentralized Crypto Derivatives?

In the world of traditional finance, a derivative is an investment contract that derives its value from an underlying asset, enabling investors to hold or trade assets without having to own them directly.

Derivatives allow investors to hedge positions, speculate on market movements, transfer risk to other parties, and take leveraged positions.

Decentralized derivatives, or DeFi derivatives, are blockchain-native derivatives contracts that use smart contracts to automate the terms of contracts, thereby removing the need for brokers. Settlement happens automatically on-chain when the contract terms have been fulfilled.

Decentralized derivatives value often track crypto markets, though, in some cases, you will find that they also track traditional assets like fiat and commodities. Several decentralized derivative protocols allow you to create synthetic assets, whose value is tied to underlying physical assets.

Furthermore, many crypto exchanges offering decentralized derivatives allow traders to use leverage. Leverage is a way for derivative traders to increase their potential gains (while the risk may also increase) by investing a small amount of capital upfront.

In other words, if you speculate the price of a specific cryptocurrency will rise, instead of buying a certain amount of cryptocurrency at the current market price - commonly called spot buying - you can leverage up a smaller amount using derivatives to potentially record higher profits.

Best Decentralized Derivatives Trading Protocols

The total value locked in the decentralized derivatives market is currently around $27 billion. Let's take a look at the decentralized derivatives exchanges where most of this value is held and transferred.

dYdX

dYdX is a decentralized crypto derivative protocol that offers multiple margin trading and perpetual contracts for traders.

The bulk of dYdX’s crypto margin trading products is based on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol has also incorporated a layer-2 scaling solution that is based on Starkwire’s StarkEx scalability engine. The scaling solution allows dYdX users to enjoy low-cost as well as instant transactions on the protocol.

The native token of the dYdX exchange is DYDX. This is an ERC-20 governance token that allows you to participate in the dYdX governance process as well as receive discounts on trading fees when using the platform. DYDX token holders are allowed to propose protocol changes and earn a profit through staking.

The protocol supports derivative trading on leverage and enables users to allocate funds in their trading accounts. Presently, dYdX offers a maximum of 25x leverage on synthetic assets with no expiry date.

As of 28, October 2022, the total value locked (TVL) of DYDX in Ethereum-based smart contracts is worth $384 million.

Hegic

Hegic is an on-chain options trading protocol on the Ethereum blockchain focused on simplifying complex financial instruments.

Hegic offers hedge contracts and Ethereum-based liquidity pools. A hedge contract is an on-chain, option-like contract that enables holders to trade an asset at a certain price and obligates sellers to buy or sell an asset at a certain period.

According to its site, users of Hegic have traded over 11,000 options contracts worth +$1.2 billion in total cumulative volume in the past two years.

The Hegic protocol has its ERC-20 native utility token known as HEGIC. The token is used to distribute settlement fees to token holders as well as quarterly disbursements of transaction fees accrued by the platform. HEGIC holders can also participate in the governance of the Hegic protocol and get a discount when purchasing contracts.

The Hegic protocol is unique in the sense that its ETH pool is non-custodial, and the liquidity providers can earn rewards in ETH. All the ETH deposited in the pool is used to sell ETH call options. Holders of these call options can exchange their DAI tokens for ETH at the strike price after expiry. Hegic’s DAI pool is for DAI liquidity providers and is used to sell ETH put options.

As of 28, October 2022, the total value locked (TVL) of HEGIC tokens on Arbitrum’s layer-2 solution is $1.4 million.

Lyra

Lyra protocol is an option automated market maker (AMM) that enables traders to trade cryptocurrency options against a pool of liquidity.

Lyra is based on Ethereum’s layer-2 solution Optimism and operates as a decentralized options exchange that gives traders access to these types of crypto markets, thereby offering them low fees and almost instant transactions.

LYRA is the native token for the Lyra protocol and, as described in LEAP-26 , is designed to reward protocol users and long-term Lyra loyalists with governance tokens. Staking LYRA provides you with several incentives, including staking rewards, vault rewards, trading rebates, and LYRA/ETH liquidity pool rewards. The Lyra protocol is governed by an autonomous council enabled by the LYRA token.

The platform has two main types of user categories: liquidity providers and options traders. Liquidity providers deposit the sUSD stablecoin into an asset-specific market maker vault (MMVs), and this liquidity is used to create buy and sell options markets for the asset that the vault is based on.

As of 28, October 2022, the total value locked (TVL) of LYRA tokens on Optimism is $15.62 million.

Synthetix

Synthetix is a derivatives liquidity protocol that currently accounts for over 60 percent of the total value locked in synthetic DeFi assets, according to DefiLlama.

Synthetix allows you to create and access synthetic assets that expose you to tokenized real-world assets on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol was initially headed by a non-profit foundation, but this setup was discarded in June 2020. Today, Synthetix is controlled by three different DAOs.

The native token of the Synthetix protocol is SNX. To collateralize an asset on Synthetix, you need to buy SNX tokens, which, once locked in a smart contract, can be used to generate synths. The value of SNX locked will need to remain at par or above 750% of the value of the respective synth created according to protocol rules.

Synthetix allows users to trade any synths with little to no slippage and offers liquidity for several assets. Synthetix users can also stake SNX tokens and gain additional benefits, such as earning a portion of network trading fees and newly minted SNX tokens.

As of 28, October 2022, the total value locked (TVL) of SNX tokens in Ethereum smart contracts is worth $272.13 million.

GMX

GMX is a decentralized perpetual exchange that enables you to trade several crypto assets with up to 30x leverage directly from your wallet.

The exchange aggregates different price feeds to determine when liquidations are supposed to happen, thereby attempting to keep a trader’s position safe from temporary wicks.

GMX is the native utility and governance token of the GMX protocol. GMX token holders get up to 30 percent of the protocol’s generated fees. On the other hand, GLP is the liquidity provider token. Up to 70 percent of the platform’s fees are accrued and go to GLP token holders.

GMX supports low swap fees and zero-price impact trades. Trading on the platform is supported by a multi-asset pool that involves market making, asset rebalancing, leverage trading, and more. In return for providing liquidity to the platform, liquidity providers earn fees from their activities. Dynamic pricing on the platform is supported by decentralized oracles, along with TWAP pricing from leading decentralized exchanges.

As of 28, October 2022, the total value locked (TVL) of GMX tokens on Ethereum’s second-layer solution Arbitrum is $407 million.

Ribbon Finance

Ribbon uses derivatives like options to generate risk-adjusted yields. Essentially, users just deposit their assets, and smart contracts handle the rest.

The Ribbon protocol is based on the Ethereum blockchain but is also available on Solana and Avalanche. It enables developers to design arbitrarily structured products through a combination of decentralized derivatives. These structured products use several types of derivatives to achieve some specific risk-reward outcomes, such as enhancing yields, speculating on market volatility, and more.

The Ribbon protocol is managed by the Ribbon DAO. RBN is the native governance token of the Ribbon protocol. RBN can also be used to boost rewards for staked vault tokens as well as earn holders a share of protocol revenue.

The Ribbon protocol makes it easy to participate in robust high-yield strategies by simplifying them into one-click deposit vaults and providing a clear user interface. This helps users understand how their profits fluctuate based on prevailing market conditions.

As of 28, October 2022, the total value locked (TVL) of RBN in Ethereum smart contracts is $76.23 million.

UMA

UMA is a decentralized Ethereum-based protocol that aims to make financial markets universally accessible, censorship-free, as well as unrestrained by any pre-existing social and financial capital. That way, UMA is highly aligned with Ethereum’s objectives. UMA offers an optimistic oracle that provides data to smart contracts using a “verification mechanism” to submit accurate feeds.

The UMA protocol has a governance token known as UMA that is used to contribute to voting on proposals, price requests, and dispute resolution.

UMA’s oracle system provides data for several projects, including a cross-chain bridge, insurance protocols, prediction markets, and custom derivatives. UMA’s oracle also supports Outcome Finance, a DAO tooling platform that supports KPI Options, Success Tokens, and Optimistic governance.

As of 28, October 2022, the total value locked (TVL) of UMA tokens in Ethereum smart contracts is $11.58 million.

","Top 7 Decentralized Derivatives Trading PlatformsDecentralized derivatives are a new way for traders to trade crypto assets without directly holding them.
Decentralized derivatives, or DeFi derivatives, are blockchain-native derivatives contracts that use smart contracts to automate the terms of contracts, thereby removing the need for brokers.
Decentralized derivatives value often track crypto markets, though, in some cases, you will find that they also track traditional assets like fiat and commodities.
Furthermore, many crypto exchanges offering decentralized derivatives allow traders to use leverage.

2022-10-31 08:43:03.298379,BeInCrypto,Polkadex Has Released the Polkadex Orderbook Decentralized Exchange,"Just over a year after the launch of the Polkadex mainnet, the Polkadex Orderbook is now open for trading.

The revolutionary orderbook-based decentralized exchange (DEX) is set to be a game-changer for digital asset trading and DeFi.

In the last few years, DEXs like Uniswap have changed the way in which cryptocurrency is traded by giving traders control over their own funds.

However, the automated market maker (AMM) model popularized by such DEXs has been plagued with exorbitant transaction fees, price slippage, frontrunning, low interoperability, and limited functionality.

While it may be riskier due to potential hacks and data breaches, many crypto traders still prefer to use the advanced trading features of centralized exchanges (CEXs), which are cheaper to use and offer high levels of functionality and interoperability.

“This is the first time an orderbook is connected to two leading ecosystems, Ethereum and Polkadot, directly.” We will continue to evolve as a cross-chain DEX connected to all leading ecosystems and sourcing native liquidity from BTC, XRP, MATIC, etc. ” said Gautham J, CEO, and Co-Founder of Polkadex

Polkadex Orderbook’s cutting-edge architecture means that while it may look, feel, and perform like a centralized exchange (CEX), it remains non-custodial and preserves the security aspect of DEXs.

A unique combination of blockchain and trusted execution environment (TEE) technology, Polkadex Orderbook is not only the first project to use the Substrate Abstraction Layer for SGX technology to build a decentralized exchange, but it is also one of the first retail use cases of this technology in general.



With the decentralized security of a layer 2 DEX built on top of the Polkadex network and a sleek CEX-like interface containing advanced trading features (including limit and market orders), the Polkadex Orderbook elegantly bridges the gap between centralized and decentralized trading.

Built to be capable of scaling to high-frequency trading, Polkadex Orderbook is as fast–if not faster than–existing CEXs.

“We will continue to position our DEX to empower the global trading community and drive towards a paradigm shift in being the torchbearer for trustlessness,” said Deepansh Singh, COO and Co-Founder of Polkadex.

While this release is the culmination of almost two years of work, it is only the beginning of what Polkadex has set out to accomplish.

Currently, Polkadex Orderbook will only be supporting one trading pair, PDEX/USDT, with USDT being bridged over from Ethereum through ChainBridge.

After a bug bounty program with the aim of further securing the platform, the Polkadex team will start ramping up support for more trading pairs with v2.0 coming within the next six months.

In the future, Polkadex will replace ChainBridge with its own tailored decentralized bridging mechanism, THEA, which will allow deposits and withdrawals from Ethereum to Polkadex and vice versa. THEA is set to add support for other Layer 1 networks down the line.

Also, after having won a Polkadot parachain slot in May, it will soon connect its parachain to the Polkadex network and pave the way for assets from across the Polkadot parachain ecosystems to be tradeable.

Both THEA and the Polkadex parachain will allow the Orderbook to become the first interoperable non-custodial exchange capable of high-frequency trading.

“We are trying to bridge the gap between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0. This is the first time an application-specific blockchain is designed from the ground up for an actual use case. “Polkadex will be pioneering a new era in blockchain economics,” said Vivek Prasannan, Executive Director and Co-Founder.

A closer look at the best altcoins to invest in 2023

Considering just how many digital currencies are now in circulation – choosing the best altcoins for your portfolio is no easy feat. You’ll also need to choose the best altcoin exchange with the lowest fees.

You’ll need to research key metrics surrounding the goals of the project, its historical price action, current market capitalisation, and more. with this in mind, the sections below offer a full analysis of the overall best altcoins to invest in this year:

1. Ethereum

Ethereum is overall the best altcoin to buy today. Ethereum needs no introduction, as the blockchain network has become the go-to for decentralised application (dapp) developers worldwide. Ethereum’s network provides the foundation for these apps, thanks to its smart contract functionality. These smart contracts remove the middleman from certain transactions, making the process entirely decentralised. Considering ethereum’s use cases and massive rallies it’s done, it definitely is one of the hottest cryptocurrency to buy right now.

Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation. it’s the biggest altcoin, and went on a massive bull run in 2021, reaching its current all-time high (ath) of $4,840. The coin has made new lows since then, but the project’s future has given investors hope of another price spike.

Some analysts predict that ethereum will reach $12,000 by 2025. That will mean that the ethereum bull run will last for at least four years, since it started in 2021. Anything is possible, but we have to use the history of the crypto market to base our decision and the crypto market has never been in a four-year bull run and without massive crashes.

2. Apecoin (ape)

The best new altcoin to invest in 2023 is apecoin. Many investors believe that apecoin is the hottest cryptocurrency for 2023, thanks to the coin’s link to the super-popular bored ape yacht club (bayc) nft collection. Bayc is undoubtedly one of the best nfts to buy and has achieved cult status within the market. This status has aided apecoin, helping its price surge over 270 per cent in the weeks following its listing.

Apecoin could be the hottest cryptocurrency to buy due to its price potential, which will be heavily influenced by its ‘meme’ status. However, apecoin also has various use cases, such as being used in ‘the otherside’. This is the bayc creators’ latest project and looks set to be one of the best metaverse platforms of 2023.

Ape has also been integrated into several blockchain-based games, such as the popular benji bananas platform. Furthermore, since apecoin is structured as a dao, the token holders have the final say regarding governance. Although its price has fallen recently, apecoin remains one of the hottest altcoins of the year.

3. The sandbox

the next crypto to explode from our list of the best altcoins to buy in 2023 is the sandbox. in a nutshell, this project specialises in the metaverse, whereby players from all over the world can explore the sandbox ecosystem while communicating and networking.

Within the sandbox metaverse, users can create and personalise their own character, which can then be used to compete in play to earn games. This means that when certain tasks are accomplished, users can earn the platform’s in-game currency – sand. What we also like about the sandbox is that it is home to an abundance of nfts.

For instance, the sandbox allows you to use your sand tokens to buy plots of land. You can then build property on this land and attempt to sell the respective nft on the open marketplace. As a prime example of how lucrative this can be, a sandbox user recently sold 100 virtual islands for the crypto-equivalent of $4.2 million.

In terms of how sand has performed in the market itself, this altcoin has generated huge returns since it was launched. According to coinmarketcap, the sandbox was initially priced at $0.05 in mid-2020. This altcoin last peaked in november 2021, whereby a price of over $8.40 was breached.

And as such, this translates into gains of over 16,000 per cent. Not bad for just over one year of trading. With that being said, and like most altcoins in this industry, sand has since retreated in value. As of writing, you can buy this top-rated altcoin at a heavily discounted price of under $3 per token.

4. Theta (theta)

Did you know that theta is one of the most undervalued altcoin and best utility cases in 2023?

Those who invest in cryptocurrency regularly may have heard of theta, which has burst onto the scene over the past year. Theta is considered one of the best new crypto coins because it aims to revolutionise how video streaming works. TAhis is accomplished by making the process decentralised rather than centralised (as is the case with youtube).

Content creators will get paid for sharing videos in tfuel – one of the theta network’s native tokens. The network uses the theta token for governance, although it can also be used for staking, which exchanges it into tfuel. Finally, theta has already garnered investment from leading companies like sony and samsung, highlighting why it is the top crypto altcoin on our list.

5. Ftx token (ftt)

Another one of the best new altcoin to consider adding to your portfolio is ftx token. Ftx has emerged as one of the best crypto exchanges in the last few years, offering over 300 cryptocurrencies for users to trade. Like other exchanges, Ftx has its own native cryptocurrency called ‘Ftx token’, which is used to enhance the user experience.

iIt's a top altcoin to buy and has various use cases within the Ftx ecosystem, such as being used to reduce trading fees and staking. Ftx token is also used as collateral for futures positions since the platform focuses heavily on derivatives.

However, those looking to buy cryptocurrency for speculative reasons can also purchase FtT to gain exposure to the Ftx platform’s growth. Ftt’s price rose a staggering 2,290 per cent between november 2020 and september 2021, reaching an all-time high of $85. Although the price is well below that now, this highlights the token’s potential if a rebound were to occur.

6. Yearn.finance

Another great altcoin to buy and invest in decentralised financial services is Yearn.finance. We are huge proponents of the business model employed by Yearn.finance – which specialises in decentralised financial services. Put simply, the platform connects borrowers and investors – meaning that there is no longer a requirement for a third-party intermediary. Instead, crypto loans at Yearn.finance are facilitated loans via automated smart contracts.

iBy its basic form, borrowers are required to put up a certain amount of collateral in the form of digital tokens. In return, the smart contract will then allow the user to borrow an amount of capital against the said collateral. And, in addition to returning the funds back within an agreed timeframe, the borrower will also be required to pay interest.

At the other end of the transaction, you have investors. Said investors will deposit funds into the Yearn.finance ecosystem, which is then used to facilitate loans. In turn, investors will be paid a yield on their capital outlay – with the specific apy design on a variety of factors – such as the respective token and lending terms.

If you like the sound of this top-rated defi coin project, you can easily buy Yearn.finance from the comfort of your home. This is the case even though Yearn.finance is one of the most expensive altcoins in the market. For instance, the digital currency hit highs of over $90,000 in 2021 – making it even more valuable than bitcoin in token terms.

With that said, you can invest from just $10 into Yearn.finance when using etoro. Nevertheless, in terms of its performance, Yearn.finance and its yti token were initially priced at just under $1,000 in 2020 – as per coinmarketcap. Moving into 2023, the same altcoin is trading at less than $19,000. This means that since it was launched, this altcoin has grown by over 1,800 per cent.

7. Cosmos

If you haven’t previously come across the term interoperability, in the traditional computing industry this refers to two or more systems having the capacity to communicate with one another. In the cryptocurrency arena, interoperability, therefore, refers to the challenges faced by different blockchain networks that may have the need to share data.

These challenges have, however, since been allocated with the growth of cosmos and its atom token. In a nutshell, cosmos provides the required technology for the likes of bitcoin and cardano or eos and ripple to collect and share data. This means that in theory, ethereum smart contracts can make decisions based on specific bitcoin transactions.

And, in order for competing blockchains to use this innovative technology, the atom token is required. And as such, this is why atom is one of the best-performing altcoins of recent years. As per coinmarketcap, atom was priced at just $7.50 back in early 2019. as of early 2022, atom breached a price of $43 per token.

And as such, this represents very healthy gains of over 480 per cent in just under three years of trading activity. With that being said, cosmos and its native atom token have since dropped in value in line with the wider altcoin marketplace. As such, you can now get your hands on this altcoin at a bargain price of under $30 per token.

8. Uniswap

Another top-rated project that makes our list of the best altcoins to buy in 2023 is uniswap. Founded in 2018, uniswap was one of the first exchanges to introduce the concept of decentralised trading. In a nutshell, this means that people can now buy and sell altcoins without needing to go through a centralised exchange.

If you’re wondering how this is possible, there are certain innovative factors at play. First and foremost, uniswap does not rely on traditional bid/ask order books to create a safe and fair trading space for the generation of sufficient levels of liquidity. On the contrary, uniswap uses an amm – or automated market maker model.

Put simply, the amm model determines altcoin prices based on a variety of factors – such as demand, volume, and market capitalisation. In addition to decentralised trading services, uniswap also gives you the opportunity to earn a yield on your idle altcoins.

This is because you can provide the uniswap amm with liquidity, which in turn, will generate interest in your deposit. Moreover, you can invest in the broader uniswap ecosystem by purchasing its uni token – which is one of the most popular altcoins to buy right now.

According to coinmarketcap, the uni token was trading at just under $7 in late 2020. After going through a somewhat rocky ride in the following few months, uniswap then went on a rapid upside trend. In fact, the uni token hit highs of just over $44 in mid-2021 – which translates into gains of more than 500 per cent.

9. Decentraland

If you have an interest in the future of metaverse coins, then you might have liked the sound of the sandbox – which we analysed above. With that said, decentraland is also one of the best altcoins to buy in 2023 if this niche marketplace is something you wish to gain exposure to.

This super-popular project – which was founded in 2017, is now used by thousands of people each and every day. These numbers continue to grow and perhaps, most importantly, so does the number of transactions being conducted in the decentraland ecosystem. More specifically, decentraland has facilitated some huge digital real estate trades in recent months.

For example, in late 2021, an area within the decentraland metaverse known as fashion street estate, sold for a reported $2.4 million. Crucially, decentraland allows users of all budgets to buy plots of land, which then can be used to build real estate projects. And in turn, each project can then be sold on the decentraland nft marketplace.

Each and every transaction executed within the decentraland ecosystem is conducted in the platform’s native altcoin – mana. And with this in mind, it goes without saying that mana has performed extremely well since it was launched in late 2017. As per stats extracted from coinmarketcap, you would have originally paid just $0.025 per mana token.

When the project last peaked in late 2021 with the wider metaverse scene, mana was trading at over $5.90. This means that those buying into this project in late 2017 would have been looking at end-to-end profits in excess of 23,000 per cent. As such, a mere investment of just $500 would have translated into a portfolio worth over $115,000.

Virtual currencies are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk.

10. Solana

Solana, alongside a number of other altcoins, is often referred to as an ethereum killer. This means that many market commentators believe that solana could one day overtake ethereum as the leading smart contract platform. But is solana a good investment? the main reason for this is that the solana blockchain is significantly more efficient in terms of speed, scalability, and fees.

For example, in its current form, ethereum is only able to facilitate an average of 16 transactions per second. In comparison, the solana blockchain can reportedly handle over 65,000 transactions per second. Moreover, you might be aware of the ongoing issues that ethereum has with respect to high fees.

In a nutshell, transactions taking place on the ethereum blockchain – no matter how small, average $4 as of writing. This means that ethereum is not suitable for processing micro-transactions – which is crucial in the smart contract scene. In comparison, solana is able to process transactions at less than 1/1000th of a cent, making it one of the greenest cryptocurrency.

The aforementioned capabilities of the solana blockchain has resulted in its native altcoin – sol, becoming a top-10 cryptocurrency project in terms of market capitalisation. Looking at the price performance of sol, coinmarketcap notes that it was priced at just $0.78 in early 2020.

Since then, solana has breached highs of over $260. To put this rapid growth into perspective, this represents gains of over 33,000 per cent in just under two years of trading. Moving into 2023, however, solana has since hit lows of $80-ish, which means that now could be a great time to enter the market. There’s no doubt that solana is one of the hottest cryptocurrency to buy right now.

What are altcoins?

The term altcoin is an abbreviated way of discussing alternative coins to bitcoin. This means that of the 18,000+ digital tokens listed on coinmarketcap, each and every project can be classified as an altcoin – apart from btc.

And as such, this means that you have a significant number of altcoins to consider for your cryptocurrency portfolio. It is important to note that altcoins will vary considerably in terms of the project and roadmap targets, market capitalisation, historical performance, and legitimacy.

As a result, knowing which altcoins to buy can be challenging. For instance, while the likes of shiba inu and bnb have generated life-changing returns since being launched, many altcoins have since lost over 95 per cent in value. Therefore, when deciding on which altcoins to buy for 2023, you will need to do lots of homework.

Are altcoins a good investment?

If you’re wondering whether you should buy altcoins or just stick with bitcoin, this section is for you. Within it, we discuss some of the main reasons why you might consider investing in a selection of top-rated altcoins today.

Many altcoins have generated life-changing returns

First and foremost, perhaps the main reason why you might consider buying a selection of altcoins today is that many projects have generated life-changing returns.

We gave some examples earlier in our analysis of the best altcoins for 2023, but allow us to elaborate further.

For example, we mentioned just a moment ago that when bnb was launched in late 2017, a single token was worth just $0.11.

And, as of writing, the project is carrying 52-week highs of $690.

This equates to end-to-end gains in excess of 690,000 per cent. and as such, had you invested just $1,000, at its peak, your money would have been worth $6.9 million.

In another example, we also mentioned that decentraland and its mana token has since witnessed growth of 23,000 per cent. And therefore, a $1,000 investment into this altcoin would have been worth over $230,000.



With that said, and as we covered earlier, not all altcoins will perform as well as the likes of bnb and decentraland – so it’s important that you set yourself realistic expectations before you make a purchase.

Altcoins outperform bitcoin

It is not only altcoins that have generated life-changing returns since launching. After all, it is important to remember that when bitcoin was first launched in 2009, it was worth just a small fraction of $0.01 per token. And, when you consider that bitcoin has since hit highs of over $68,000 – this represents end-to-end gains in the millions of percentage points.

However, bitcoin has since become a multi-trillion dollar asset class, so it goes without saying that the upside potential will be limited from hereon. In fact, when you compare the performance of bitcoin over the prior few years with that of top-rated altcoins, btc isn’t as attractive as it once was.

For example, in the prior 12 months since writing this page, the price of bitcoin has decreased by over 20 per cent. in comparison, ethereum has increased by nearly 50 per cent. over a 5-year period, bitcoin has increased by 3,600 per cent, while ethereum has witnessed gains of more than 7,000 per cent.

As such, if your main priority is to target high-performing crypto assets, then altcoins might be more suitable for your risk appetite when compared with bitcoin.

Easy to diversify

Another major benefit of adding the best altcoins to your portfolio is that you can easily diversify to help mitigate the risk of loss. This is something that most traders and investors adhere to when learning how to trade cryptocurrency.

Sure, on the one hand, the cryptocurrencies market often moves in sync with one another, meaning that when bitcoin does well, so do altcoins. However, it also goes without saying that some altcoins have performed considerably better than others.

And as such, you can give yourself the best chance possible of choosing the best-performing altcoins by adding a wide selection of tokens to your portfolio.

This can be achieved easily when you use an online broker that not only offers small minimum investment requirements, but also a large number of supported markets.

For instance, at the sec-regulated broker etoro, you will have access to dozens of leading altcoins at a minimum trade value of just $10 per token.

Many altcoins are cheap

Another reason why bitcoin – or even ethereum for that matter, is somewhat unattractive to value investors is that these tokens are now trading for a huge amount of money.

After all, bitcoin and ethereum have since breached highs of approximately $68,000 and $5,000 respectively. This means that by investing a modest amount of money, you will likely only be able to purchase a tiny fraction of one token.

However, when researching the best altcoins for 2023, we came across a number of notable projects that still carry a low entry price.

For example, we mentioned earlier that by investing just $100 into shiba inu, you can get yourself about 5 million tokens.

Similarly, if you were to invest $100 into basic attention token, this would get you over 800 tokens as of writing.

Crucially, although the price of an altcoin doesn’t dictate its total valuation alone, it can be a lot more attractive to invest in a cryptocurrency project that allows you to own a large number of tokens – as opposed to a small fraction.

Huge upside potential

Many experienced traders will also seek out the best altcoins in the market because in many cases, the upside potential can be huge as we have witnessed the sharp increase in shiba inu and dogecoin in 2021.

For example, once you skip through the first few hundred projects in terms of market capitalisation, you will come across thousands of altcoins that carry a valuation of less than $10 million. And as such, this means that the upside potential on these altcoins is going to be much higher than those that already have a large-cap status.

Another thing to be aware of when buying low-cap altcoins is that those with a considerably small market valuation will be a lot more volatile. This is because of the fundamentals of market depth, which means that smaller-cap assets are easier to move in the market.

Innovation outside of financial payments

We also like altcoins for the innovation that some projects have since introduced to the cryptocurrency sector. Sure, bitcoin itself is revolutionary. But, the network is only able to facilitate global payments.

In the case of the best altcoins that we came across, some of the most notable projects offer the following:

Decentraland and the sandbox both offer virtual 3d worlds that allow users to buy plots of land and real estate, and then sell these in the open market via nfts.

Cosmos is solving the issue of blockchain interoperability.

Solana is looking to challenge ethereum’s dominance of smart contracts, with super-fast, scalable, and low-cost transactions.

The above examples are just a few of many. the key point is that by investing in an altcoin that offers something different from the status quo, there is every chance that the respective token will perform well.

Where to buy altcoins

When deciding on where to buy altcoins for your portfolio, we would suggest exploring the following metrics before you open an account with your chosen exchange or broker:

Is the platform regulated by a reputable licensing body such as the fca or sec?

What altcoins does the platform give you access to?

What fees and commissions will you need to pay to buy your chosen altcoins?

Where does the platform stand in terms of customer service and supported payment methods?

What is the minimum amount of money you will need to risk to buy altcoins at the platform?

Taking the above metrics into account, we found that etoro is the overall best place to buy altcoins in 2023. We explain why in the section below.

>>>Buy altcoins now<<<

Virtual currencies are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk.

Etoro – best place to buy altcoins in 2023

Etoro is our pick for the best crypto platform that is ideal for investors of all skill sets. Opening an account here takes minutes – and the kyc verification process can be completed instantly. We like the fact that etoro is regulated by multiple bodies – including the sec, asic, fca, and cysec.

This means that you can buy altcoins without needing to worry about the safety of your funds – which can’t be said for many exchanges in this space. Clients can deposit funds in usd without paying any fees. Crucially, this is the case not only with ach and domestic bank wires but e-wallets like paypal and even debit/credit cards.

And, if you’re a new customer from the us, you only need to deposit $10 to get started. In terms of supported altcoins, etoro lists dozens of leading crypto assets. For example, you can buy dogecoin on etoro with a fee of just 1% which is then added to the tight bid-ask spread.

You will also save on traditional trading commissions when you buy altcoins via the etoro website, as you only need to cover the spread.

We also like etoro for its diversification tools, which include professionally-managed portfolios that contain a wide range of altcoins. For example, you could invest in ethereum with competitive fees.

This particular investment product will suit time-starved investors or those with little to no experience in performing technical analysis. Etoro is also home to copy trading tools, so again, this will appeal to those seeking a passive investment experience. When it comes to customer service, etoro offers a live chat facility – so there is no need to wait around for an email reply.

We also like etoro as the best crypto app for the free virtual portfolios that it offers to both new and existing clients. This comes pre-loaded with $100,000, which you can then use to trade altcoins in a risk-free environment.

Twitter struggling to keep other active users

An internal Reuters report says that Twitter is having trouble keeping its largest user base.

Twitter is in absolute decline, and its most active users are losing interest.

This is as per a report created by Twitter staff members and seen by Reuters. According to Twitter’s internal documents, heavy tweeters make up less than 10% of all monthly users.

Tweeter & Elon Musk

However, these tweeters account for half of the global revenue and 90 percent of all tweets.

Where have all the tweeters gone? the employee inquired. in the document from within. Heavy tweeters have been in absolute decline since the pandemic began, they added.

The report analyzed the number of regular tweeters in English who showed interest in a subject. There were no conclusions reached by the study regarding the reasons for the decline in platform heavy users.

According to the document, a person is considered to be a heavy tweeter if they use the platform six to seven days per week and tweet three to four times per week.

Musk believes that the most well-known individuals on the platform have left the ship.

Reuters claims that the microblogging site has not disclosed its metrics.

This is because Elon Musk’s deadline to close the 44 billion dollar acquisition agreement was getting closer.

The following are among the platform’s most popular: Among others are Justin Bieber, Rihanna, Christiano Ronaldo, Tylor Swift, Lady Gaga, and Elon Musk.

The meme coin is worth $0.1351 after gaining 130% in seven days.

Six weeks back, DOGE traded at a measly $0.06156, with a market value of $8 billion.

After Elon Musk’s last week’s takeover of the social networking platform Twitter, investor appetite for the most popular meme token has skyrocketed significantly.

Data available on the market tracking website CoinMarketCap shows that Dogecoin (DOGE) has flipped Cardano (ADA) to become the eighth most prominent cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization.

The meme coin currently trades at $0.1351, with over 60% appreciation in the previous 24 hours, putting its seven-day cumulative performance above 130%. Exactly six weeks ago, Coin Edition reported that DOGE had surpassed (DOT) to be the tenth-largest cryptocurrency by market share. At the time, DOGE traded at a measly $0.06156, with a market value barely above $8 billion.

Interestingly, current data from the market shows the DOGE meme token gained over 100% of its value in a month. The current market value of DOGE and ADA are over $18 and $14 billion, respectively, with DOGE leading by over four billion. Notably, DOGE claimed the $4 billion increase over Cardano within 24 hours.

Another interesting fact is that the trading volume of DOGE over ADA within the last 24 hours is over 140% apart. While nearly $15 billion worth of buying and selling happened with the meme token, ADA’s 24-hour trading volume is below $1 million. Nonetheless, the Cardano token’s performance within the previous seven days has been impressive, with over 19% gains.

The crypto market, in general, has been bullish since last week, with BTC gaining over 9%. (ETH) was the second-best performer in the market after DOGE, with over 25% in seven days. Ethereum is worth $1,635, the highest value seven weeks after its blockchain migrated to the efficient proof-of-stake consensus.

2022-10-31 09:43:03.350012,Decrypt,"Elon Musk, Twitter, Dogecoin, Bluesky, and the Decentralized Social Media Race","Elon actually did it. The gleeful jester king of Crypto Twitter—whose tweets about Dogecoin have repeatedly moved the price, whose July 2018 ""pedo guy"" tweet about a British cave diver landed him in court for defamation (he won), whose August 2018 ""funding secured"" tweet led to securities fraud charges from the SEC ($20 million fine)—now owns the company.

When this story began six months ago (!) with Musk's original $44 billion offer, I wrote, ""Musk probably won't get to buy Twitter. But crypto advocates should be cheering him on if they want to see Twitter ever really embrace crypto tools."" I was wrong on the first count; the second is still unanswered, but is heating up fast.

Musk originally said, both publicly and in private (since-leaked) text messages, that he aimed to put Twitter on-chain and make it open-source, accept Dogecoin for payments for Twitter services, and go after crypto spam bots.

But then, in texts with a representative for FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, Musk wrote, ""Blockchain Twitter isn’t possible. The bandwidth and latency requirements cannot be supported by a peer to peer network, unless those ‘peers’ are absolutely gigantic, thus defeating the purpose of a decentralized network.""

And yet! Binance, the biggest crypto exchange in the world, backed Musk's final buy to the tune of $500 million, and is ""creating an internal team to focus on ways that blockchain and crypto could be helpful to Twitter,"" the company told Decrypt on Friday. Binance believes it has Musk's ear.

Regardless of your opinion of Musk, anyone who believes in the future viability of crypto and blockchain solutions and would like to see more mass adoption should be excited to see what happens next.

Twitter users who are loudly railing against his ownership and threatening to leave will mostly not leave. The irony is that if they do, many of their other options also now have a crypto connection.

Facebook is so committed to the metaverse it renamed its company Meta, and even after its metaverse division Reality Labs lost $3.6 billion in Q3, sending the stock plummeting more than 25%, it must double down on the strategy. It is unclear how much Meta's metaverse will utilize crypto and blockchain, but recall that the company already tried to create its own cryptocurrency once before.

Jack Dorsey, clearly a confidante of Musk who might counsel him on what to do at Twitter, has departed Twitter to focus on Block, formerly Square, which, like Facebook, was so intent on publicly proving its commitment to a new area of tech that it changed its corporate name. But Dorsey's separate ""decentralized social media"" effort Bluesky—birthed inside Twitter and now independent—has just launched a web site for its AT Protocol (it stands for Authenticated Transport) and opened the waitlist for its Bluesky app, which the team frames as a ""browser"" for accessing the AT Protocol.

Bluesky is pursuing Dorsey's vision of putting Twitter onto a protocol—just don't call it blockchain (or Web3, since Dorsey doesn't believe in that).

This article uses the word ""blockchain"" 7 times and describes the @at_protocol as a ""blockchain-based social media platform"", but please take a closer look at our design: there's no blockchain. https://t.co/5KiDOyn9i4 — Jay Graber (@arcalinea) October 20, 2022

Even Kanye West is in the mix with Parler, the right-wing social media app he is buying. Parler launched an NFT marketplace in March called DeepRedSky that debuted with a Trump NFT collection. Kanye himself has praised Bitcoin and was recently spotted wearing a Satoshi Nakamoto cap.

Discord backed away from crypto wallet integration due to outrage from gamers, but remains the most popular home for DAOs, the crypto organizations that run on community voting.

Mastodon, a ""decentralized social media platform"" launched in 2016 that uses a network of open-source servers, gained 30,000 new signups on the day Musk bought Twitter.

Even though some of these apps I've listed would say they have nothing to do with crypto, it's striking that so many social media platforms are looking at using decentralization, the utopian rallying cry of the crypto industry, to improve their UX or foster free speech.

I first wrote about Bitcoin in 2011, and what excited me most back then was the possibility of using crypto to pay for a paywalled news article, without the friction of entering your credit card info and subscribing for a whole year.

2022-10-31 07:43:03.351810,Cointelegraph,Tech talent migrates to Web3 as large companies face layoffs,"As inflation continues to grow, coupled with a looming recession, many tech firms are having to cut portions of their staff. To put this in perspective, data from Layoffs.fyi found that over 700 tech startups have experienced layoffs this year, impacting at least 93,519 employees globally. It has also been reported that tech giants like Google, Netflix and Apple are undergoing massive job cuts.

While many of these layoffs are likely due to an economic downturn, this has resulted in an overwhelming amount of talent flocking to early-stage Web3 companies. For example, Andrew Masanto, a serial entrepreneur who has founded a number of startups, told Cointelegraph that he recently launched Nillion, a startup specializing in decentralized computation, to help ensure privacy and confidentiality for Web3 platforms.

Although Nillion is still in its early stages, the technological innovation behind the company has already proven to be appealing. Since the company’s inception in October this year, leading talent from companies like Nike, Indiegogo and Coinbase have joined the growing startup.

For instance, Slava Rubin, founder of the crowdfunding website Indiegogo, told Cointelegraph that he had recently joined Nillion as the company’s chief business officer based on the opportunity to join a startup with an innovative business model.

“The tech behind Nillion is massively innovative, as it focuses on advancing secure multiparty computation (MPC). MPC is known for being slow and unable to work for certain use cases. The risk of failure doesn’t concern me here since it’s such a huge opportunity to solve this problem,” he said.

The notion of building technology to advance MPC also attracted Lindsay Danas Cohen to Nillion. Cohen previously served as associate general counsel at Coinbase before joining Nillion this year as the company’s general counsel.

Although Coinbase announced in June that it was cutting its staff by 18%, Cohen explained in a recent blog post that she left Coinbase to join Nillion due to the opportunity to help advance privacy and data sharing through MPC. “This would be a true zero-to-one innovation,” she wrote.

While the crypto industry continues to face a bear market, it’s clear that the projects being built during this period are seen as an exciting opportunity. “I built Indiegogo during the 2008 bear market, and I think we will see the same thing in this market. In about three to five years, we will see some very strong companies emerge that know how to use capital efficiently,” Rubin remarked.

Indeed, well-funded Web3 companies continue to hire, while large tech companies face layoffs and hiring freezes. Sebastien Borget, co-founder and chief operating officer of The Sandbox, told Cointelegraph that the popular metaverse platform currently has a total of 103 job openings. “The excitement of working in the front row of Web3 is big, and we are enjoying this interest towards our open positions,” he said.

According to Borget, The Sandbox has grown to 404 employees this year, almost doubling in size from its 208-employee workforce it had in December 2021. Borget added that The Sandbox’s virtual real estate known as “LANDs” is now worth over $1 billion in total market cap.

Moreover, as Web3 companies continue to bring on both new and acquired talent, young jobseekers seem to be displaying a greater desire to obtain the skills needed to join these firms.

Priyanka Mathikshara Mathialagan, president of the Stanford Blockchain Club, told Cointelegraph that she has seen an increasing number of undergraduate students at Stanford taking blockchain-focused courses in preparation for careers after graduation.

Recent: What the Russia-Ukraine war has revealed about crypto

“This year, we had more students enrolled in professor Dan Boneh’s cryptography class than those enrolled in traditional computer science courses,” she remarked.

Despite the bear market, Mathialagan also believes that there have been significant improvements made within the Web3 space, resulting in a more positive outlook toward the sector. For example, she mentioned that the Ethereum Merge that took place on Sept. 15 has helped ensure a more energy-efficient platform, creating appeal for students that may want to leverage the Ethereum network for Web3 projects. Mathialagan added that while a numerous amount of theoretical research has been performed for years within fields like computer science, Ph.D. students are considering Web3 due to new opportunities for advancement. She said:

“The math used in theoretical computer science and cryptography is similar to the math needed to advance zero-knowledge proof-based applications. There is now an industry that wants to pay Ph.D. students for their research and put these findings to use. For example, there is a large demand for distributed system engineers since every single blockchain is really a distributed system. These are the people who can design consensus algorithms and new architectures for scalable and secure blockchains.”

This seems to be the case, as Masanto shared that Nillion has hired 10 engineers within the last six months. Borget added that The Sandbox is currently hiring 17 engineers, along with game designers, architects and other individuals capable of supporting brands building in the company’s metaverse.

Skepticism remains

While it’s notable that Web3 companies are actively hiring, a number of concerns remain. For instance, although companies remain focused on building during a bear market, fundraising may be problematic.

Given this, it’s important to point out that Nillion is currently being bootstrapped by its founding team. A spokesperson from Delphi Digital, a crypto-focused research firm, also told Cointelegraph that while the company is currently hiring across the board, no funds have been raised.

“We have been completely bootstrapped up until now.” While impressive, running a company based on personal finances or operating revenue may be concerning for job seekers. For instance, Mathialagan noted that students starting a career in Web3 want to be assured that the company will exist two to three years down the road.

Jessica Walker, chief marketing officer of Fluid Finance — a fintech company focused on revolutionizing banking with blockchain — further told Cointelegraph that it is a waiting game to see what companies have the strongest communities and teams capable of withstanding the crypto winter, adding:

“It’s important for organizations to build partnerships and roll out products, while also being able to budget their overhead costs during this time.”

Moreover, Mathialagan believes that it’s challenging for students, along with individuals within the Web2 sector, to get connected with Web3 companies. For instance, while companies like Nillion have brought on individuals from organizations like Coinbase, Indiegogo and Nike, Masanto shared that he already knew a handful of these people prior to hiring.

Recent: Does the IMF have a vendetta against cryptocurrencies?

Walker also remarked that due to the bear market, recruiters need to pay additional attention to detail when onboarding new team members. “Some uncertainty comes from new hires about the security of their role, especially during a bear market. At Fluid, we often try to hire from our community first,” she said.

Although strategic, Mathialagan mentioned that the Stanford Blockchain Club is compiling a list of job postings to help students connect better with Web3 firms as more hiring takes place: “For students, hiring remains the biggest single problem even beyond security issues faced by Web3 companies today.”","While many of these layoffs are likely due to an economic downturn, this has resulted in an overwhelming amount of talent flocking to early-stage Web3 companies.

The token is down 60% in the last 24 hours.

Huobi’s native stablecoin HUSD has plunged to new lows. According to Wu blockchain, the exchange’s stablecoin has depegged from its dollar parity and is down 60%, trading at $0.2971

HUSD Depegs Again

After Huobi announced its decision to delist HUSD, the exchange’s stablecoin plunged to new lows, trading 60% below its price value. Huobi later announced that it would help its users convert their HUSD funds into USDT, one of the largest stablecoins by market cap.

After Huobi abandoned the original stablecoin HUSD and started using Justin Sun's USDD, the current HUSD de-pegged and the price is only $0.74, the 24-hour transaction volume is only $210,000. Huobi said it can help users convert HUSD to USDT. https://t.co/aYakOkKbuQ — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 31, 2022

HUSD’s depeg comes shortly after the exchange’s decision to delist the stablecoin. The exchange further declared how it would help its users convert their HUSD holdings into USDD, a stablecoin founded by Tron Network’s Justin Tron.

“As part of our continuous efforts to promote the healthy development of the blockchain ecosystem, Huobi Global will be ceasing the HUSD trading service and delisting HUSD in compliance with Article 11 of Huobi Global Token Management Rules The service termination and delisting of HUSD will start at 08:00 (UTC) on October 28, 2022. In the meantime, users’ HUSD assets will be converted to USDT assets at a 1:1 ratio. We will publish another announcement to notify users of the completion of the conversion, which is expected to occur before November 4, 2022 (GMT+8).” The exchange stated

Speculations are rife in the crypto market about whether Huobi has been purchased and acquired by Tron crypto founder Justin Sun. As per Wu blockchain, the firm has already been taken over by Sun, who is currently in the process of initiating mass layoffs in its bid to stabilise the exchange’s operations.

According to people familiar with the huobi, the former CEO and CFO of Huobi have resigned. Justin Sun's TRON team has taken over important departments of Huobi. Huobi has 1,600 employees, Justin Sun believes that there are too many people, and there may be large-scale layoffs. https://t.co/bdMqeYPCrE — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 29, 2022

Wu further claims that FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has played an elemental role in the entire Huobi buyout process.

“But it is rumoured that FTX has invested to help Justin Sun. This may also push Binance, which has been supporting Justin Sun, to the position of his competitor. ” As mentioned in Wu Blockchain’s substack post

The reason why the metaverse has taken off, especially in the past two years, is definitely related to the explosion of the NFT market and the latest bull run in the crypto sector.

This has given the metaverse the opportunity to expand rapidly, creating a real economy around it.

What is the metaverse and what is its relationship to crypto?

The metaverse is still something that many do not agree on in terms of meaning and definition, but the first characteristics are beginning to emerge.

They are three-dimensional spaces where users move freely using avatars to play, create, work and even make business deals.

Virtual spaces can be created by users themselves who make them available to other users.

Crypto, and sometimes fiat currencies, can be used.

Underlying virtual spaces are compatible technical standards, protocols, interoperability, digital ownership, blockchain technology, and laws governing their use.

Virtual real estate: can you invest in the metaverse?

The answer is yes: land in the metaverse is the new way to invest in the digital world, especially with crypto.

The research firm specializing in blockchain, Chainalysis, reported that virtual real estate prices grew 879% between September 2019 and March 2022. This was the period when Bitcoin yielded less than half, 362% (after the most recent collapse, as of 1 July 2022, it dropped to +98%).

According to Chainalysis’ report, buying via crypto or cryptocurrency a virtual space in the metaverse accesses some immediate benefits and others visible in the future.

By buying land in the metaverse, you can take advantage of video content, images, in-game single-player or multiplayer activities, and events.

What the metaverse will be able to offer is partly something imaginable even on future scenarios: the spaces purchased in the metaverse can certainly be rented and augmented reality tools, such as VR viewers, could be added.

Today, however, the majority of projects are in virtual reality with few links to the real world.

As far as the real estate sector of the metaverse is concerned, we are beginning to see differences related to the pricing field. According to Chainalysis, it all stems from the platform that binds to the metaverse: real estate on the Ethereum blockchain expects much higher prices than other crypto such as Solana.

The reason would stem from the fact that most Ethereum-based metaverses have recently integrated with Polygon, Ethereum’s sidechain competitor to Solana in both cost and speed performance.

One report noted:

“Since the metaverse is such a nascent space, the long-term value of blockchain-based virtual real estate depends on a number of external factors.” “While most of these factors are difficult to predict, we believe a couple of them may be,” the report says, “the possibility of AR/VR systems being more interoperable or proprietary and by the ‘pace of adoption of new information technologies.”

Microsoft, Meta, Google and other technology companies are implementing frameworks to form experiences in the metaverse but it is unknown whether the metaverse realities will be unique systems or integrated with one another.

Is it possible to buy NFTs and/or crypto related to the metaverse?

Most existing metaverses, such as Decentraland and The Sandbox, have their own tokens that power the virtual world economy.

These tokens can be purchased on the major centralized exchanges (CEX) where they are supported, or traded to other cryptocurrencies using decentralized exchanges (DEX).

In addition, each asset within the metaverse is represented by an NFT. Each digital asset can be purchased on the metaverse’s dedicated marketplace, if any, or on the secondary market by referring to platforms, such as OpenSea, Magic Eden, etc., where they are listed.

How does the purchase of NFTs for the metaverse with crypto take place?

In order to be able to proceed with one or more transactions, it is necessary to synchronize the wallet: in this way, the platform will be able to verify the presence of the necessary amount of crypto to be able to purchase.

The most popular wallets are those of Coinbase, MetaMask, Phantom and Trust Wallet.

NFTs in the metaverse

Since these are blockchain-based realities, it is inevitable that NFTs will find various applications within the metaverse. Indeed, each value here is represented by a token, and users have the ability to buy, trade, use and/or showcase their NFTs, sharing them with the community.

What is a wallet

A wallet is a virtual wallet within which to deposit, send and receive digital currency, such as Bitcoin, Dash, Ethereum, etc.

There are several types. The most popular are hardware ones that enjoy extreme security, such as Ledger; browser extensions, which are very simple and intuitive to use, such as MetaMask. And finally desktop ones, such as Exodus, or in-app format for smartphones.

How to open a wallet on MetaMask to buy NFTs

MetaMask is the most popular free wallet for buying NFTs: it is multi-chain in that it supports different blockchains, such as Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom and BNB Chain. It also allows interaction with almost all dApps. Its popularity is mainly due to its ease of use, since it is a browser extension.

To open it, you will need to open the MetaMask site and follow a few steps: simply add the extension to Chrome and then create a password and a seed phrase, a secret backup phrase.

When the wallet is set up, one can deposit a sufficient amount of crypto, usually Ether (ETH) to then purchase NFTs.

It also supports on-ramp for automatic fiat-crypto currency conversion using third-party services offered by Coinbase Pay, Wyre, Transak, and MoonPay.

Only after authorizing the connection between the wallet and the marketplace will it be possible to buy NFTs via MetaMask, based on prices set by the seller or by bidding via auction.

Once you have chosen the NFT to buy, you must click on “Make offer” or “Buy now” to proceed to the checkout stage.

MetaMask will then request a transaction signature to finalize the exchange.

At this point, the ownership of the token will be uniquely linked to the address with which the transaction was finalized. All assets held will be publicly viewable by accessing the “scans” of the relevant blockchain.","Virtual real estate: can you invest in the metaverse?

2022-10-31 07:43:04.147447,The Cryptonomist,The latest news on Polkadot,"Listen this article download

Polkadot news: the price trend of the DOT crypto has been rather flat in recent months.

The news about Polkadot and the native DOT crypto

The current price is close to that of mid-July, although slightly lower.

After peaking on 4 November 2021 at nearly $55, it began a long four-stage descent that ended precisely around mid-July.

The first phase ended as early as December, with a return around the $25 level. Thereafter, after a brief recovery, the second phase of decline immediately began, ending on 25 February at $16.

It is worth noting that $16 was also the price that DOT had reached in January 2021, that is, during the very first phase of the great bullrun of 2021.

Therefore it was possible to imagine that the decline would stop there. Instead, after a recovery of a few weeks, it began to fall again in early April.

This third phase ended at $8 in the days of the implosion of the Terra ecosystem, that is, a share equal to half of the previous one.

At that point, one might have expected further sharp declines, and instead the fourth phase stopped at $6 in mid-July.

After an admittedly rather moderate recovery, it returned to $6 after mid-September and there it has remained until now.

The current price is 88% lower than the November high of last year, and is in line with the August 2020 high.

In particular, this latest comparison suggests that the 2021 speculative bubble on DOT was particularly large. Even though when it began to inflate in December 2020 the price was lower ($5).

In other words, virtually all the gains made during the 2021 bullrun on DOT were wiped out in 2022.

Puzzling news: Gavin Wood quits Polkadot.

That the situation is far from flourishing would also be indicated by the recent resignation of Gavin Wood.

Gavin Wood is quite an important figure, because he was among the co-founders of Ethereum. In 2020 he founded Polkadot with the goal of going beyond Ethereum.

He has always been the main focus of Polkadot’s development, but he may continue to be the same.

In fact, he has only stepped down as CEO of Parity, the company that is developing Polkadot.

Wood stated that he is a developer, not an administrator, and that he never wanted to be CEO. Indeed, he also revealed that he had only agreed to be CEO for a limited period.

Moreover, he still remains the majority shareholder of the company, but from now on he will “only” be Chief Architect.

So while in some ways his stepping down as CEO could be seen as a bad sign, in reality the fact that he can devote himself 100% to being Chief Architect should be a good sign.

Indeed, while DOT lost 5% on the day he declared he was stepping down as CEO, it gained 13% in the following days.

DOT’s price predictions

For these reasons, some analysts argue that in reality DOT’s price may continue to lateralize around the $6 mark.

It has been more than three and a half months now that it has more or less been lateralizing around this mark, and it may well continue to do so for a while.

It has been fluctuating very little for almost a month and a half, with volatility so low that it seems like an anomaly. This anomaly may dissolve sooner or later, and the price of DOT may become volatile again.

However, the fact is that analysts say that this eventual volatility could also trigger new declines, because right now there are not many particularly positive indicators for Polkadot.

There are also other analysts who argue that the daily chart shows bullish signs, so in the short term volatility could also push up the price of DOT.

In addition, the Polkadot project remains one of those with the greatest theoretical potential in crypto. So current prices could also prove particularly attractive should it actually succeed over the years in doing what it promises.

Therefore in the short term, the hypothesis circulating most is that of a continuation of the lateralization phase.

In the short-to-medium term, it might even rise a bit, while in the medium-to-long term for now it does not seem to give much indication of a possible new bullrun.

Instead, in the very long term it has potential, which, however, could also only present itself in the next crypto market cycle, namely the one that will begin in 2024 with Bitcoin’s fourth halving.

Competition

As similar cases from the past show, the longer one goes, the more competition increases.

Cryptocurrencies that were able to establish themselves when there was little competition, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, now seem to have become so well established that they no longer face real competition.

Instead, cryptocurrencies that have not yet consolidated, such as DOT, will continue to suffer competition, especially from any new projects that are very quick to spread.

Polkadot is a project that has only been around for a few years, but if a direct and faster-growing competitor emerges in the next few years, it could suffer quite a bit.

Currently, to be fair, there doesn’t seem to be a real competing project to Polkadot, partly because there are very few that have one of Ethereum’s co-founders behind them.

But while competition for Polkadot does not seem to be a problem at this time, it could become one in the future if it fails to establish itself before some similar project takes off.

It is extremely difficult to implement and get a project like Polkadot off the ground, which partly explains why no real competitors have emerged to date.

But the crypto world evolves at the speed of light, so it’s not possible to say that Polkadot will continue to have no major competitors even in the future. And, for example, Ethereum itself could be suitable for some somewhat similar projects.","Listen this article downloadPolkadot news: the price trend of the DOT crypto has been rather flat in recent months.

This method’s ease and rapid response have influenced the popularity of platforms such as crypto gambling sites. However, gamblers now recognize these Bitcoin gambling sites as the best option to place their wagers.

While there is a wealth of information about these platforms available online today, it is still important to conduct adequate research before choosing one. Thankfully, The top crypto gambling sites typically have similar characteristics, so players can easily detect a fake one. The following paragraphs cover everything you need to know before picking some of the best crypto gambling sites in 2022.

About The Crypto Gambling Sites Transactions, Games, and Bonuses

It would help if you learned about the deposit and withdrawal procedures before deciding on a casino platform to play on. This offer is due to the possibility that such platforms only offer withdrawal choices in your home currency, even though you may be able to deposit on them in multiple currencies.

This step suggests that even while you can use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Tether, and Doge to play and withdraw, you might not be able to start in the same currencies. Transaction costs and unforeseen losses could emerge from this. The world’s central banks and payment institutions often take three to five business days before completing the transactions. However, this duration delays deposits, withdrawals, and gambling.

The best thing about these options is that transfers proceed swiftly, especially when it’s a deposit. However, the platform may still possess excessive withdrawal times as certain casinos use simple means of processing transactions to prevent data loss.

You may cash out your winnings at the top Bitcoin gambling sites without visiting another website or platform. Payment choices are what distinguish crypto gambling sites. In contrast to a casino that only accepts fiat money, they don’t limit their customers to a small number of options.

Casino Games Are Available

Most Bitcoin casino platforms offer a wide range of games, but not all of them are available using cryptocurrencies. These games include Bitcoin slots, roulette, arcade, and table games. Moreover, see the risk and stake profiles for the different games; even though there aren’t as many Bitcoin casinos as regular ones, the available ones are a great selection of games.

Furthermore, people universally acknowledge that players prefer a casino with a wide variety of games, especially ones that offer significant jackpots. As a result, Bitcoin gambling sites feature a far more excellent selection of games with higher return percentages than conventional online casinos. Punters can also easily wager on their favorite games, including slots, blackjack, and poker.

Unique Bonuses and Incentives

Consider the rewards and bonuses that Bitcoin gambling sites offer. You must know the limitations and payout policies for games where you can wager and win prizes depending on your prediction.

Many upscale Bitcoin casinos provide you extra incentives based on how many people are betting on the odds. For instance, Real Madrid would have better reward odds if more wagers were put on Liverpool defeating Real Madrid in a football match. The top platforms may also provide additional deposit bonuses and incentives.

The best Bitcoin gambling sites allow you to grow your wealth instead of losing it. They achieve this by rewarding their customers with significant bonuses. Thanks to these advantages, you can start living a successful life and being financially successful. The following are the top bonuses offered by cryptocurrency casinos:

Bonus funds incentives exclusive to specific cryptocurrencies are offered for withdrawals and deposits.

VIP provides perks with no money down.

Bonuses for deposits

Regulation and Licensing

Even though there are many online Bitcoin casinos and cryptocurrency gambling sites, not all of them are regulated or authorized by the state. Examine customer reviews and the company’s policies before choosing the platform that best satisfies your live casino requirements.

When a forum like this is licensed, it has undergone a thorough review and audit by a regulatory body like the well-known Malta Gaming Authority or the United Kingdom Gaming Authority. This law implies that you won’t have to worry about disappearing when you add money to your platform-based digital wallet. Even when you withdraw money, your transactions are protected and kept secure.

Usability and Accessibility of Mobile Apps

Despite websites, most of the largest Bitcoin casinos and live sportsbook betting systems are often ugly and challenging to use. In addition, only a few of the best cryptocurrency sites provide a mobile app and an engaging online app.

This offer ensures greater mobility while placing bets and makes it simpler to use directly from your phone. While giving their consumers various options, the best Bitcoin casinos put the user experience first.

The top fiat sites use cryptocurrency, especially for players from nations where gambling is not allowed. Therefore, they are eligible for all the advantages and can visit online casinos securely using cryptocurrencies. Contrarily, several digital currency websites accept players from different countries and do not restrict their operations. Furthermore, punters find it easy to process transactions, whether it is deposit or withdrawal.

Closing Thoughts

There are many more reasons to consider adopting a cryptocurrency gambling site for all possible gambling operations. Furthermore, Bitcoin games and offers provide profitable cryptocurrency investment opportunities.

Additionally, you can maintain your privacy and keep a record of your transactions on the blockchain. Therefore, this implies that Bitcoin gambling sites are highly transparent and unchanging.

2022-10-31 10:43:04.173956,NerdWallet,"At 14, Bitcoin is Battered but ‘Battle-Tested’","It might have come off as a Halloween prank — if anyone outside a small group of cryptography enthusiasts had even seen it. The blueprint for Bitcoin — real, internet money circulating beyond the reach of banks or governments — hit inboxes Oct. 31, 2008.

Fourteen years later, Bitcoin has emerged from obscurity into a major, if enigmatic, role on the global stage. Leading financial firms offer Bitcoin in retirement accounts, and some countries use it as legal tender, even as it has suffered devastating losses.

Bitcoin has demonstrated a remarkable staying power in its short lifespan, but it faces a raft of questions in the wake of its latest boom and bust. Regulators around the world are circling. And a new generation of cryptocurrencies led by Ethereum are offering credible alternatives.

Garrick Hileman, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics whose research focuses on blockchain and cryptocurrencies, says Bitcoin’s resilience may be a reason for hope.

“It’s been battle-tested in a way that no other cryptocurrency ever has … both in terms of its longevity and how much value it's been securing over that time,” Hileman says. “Nothing else comes close.”

Bitcoin’s origins

In 2008, pseudonymous author Satoshi Nakamoto released a white paper that laid out an intriguing vision amid a global financial crisis.

Posting on an obscure cryptography mailing list, Nakamoto suggested the internet could allow regular people to reclaim autonomy from centers of financial power such as banks and governments.

“What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party,” Nakamoto wrote in the nine-page document laying out Bitcoin’s basic mechanics.

If the rhetoric wasn’t polemic, the basic idea — for some — seemed downright revolutionary.

In essence, Bitcoin users would keep records of transactions in a way that would make them difficult to fabricate, duplicate or reverse. When one user would send Bitcoin to another, everyone in the network would be able to view that transaction, record it and attempt to update an immutable shared ledger known as a blockchain.

Bitcoin launched in earnest in early 2009, but at first it circulated mostly among a hard-core group of users who hotly debated what it could best be used for, what it was worth and how to persuade people to use it.

Pizza and drugs

In 2010, Bitcoin made the leap from online experiment to real-world medium exchange. Among the seminal moments was one now-infamous pizza order.

A Florida man named Laszlo Hanyecz offered to send 10,000 Bitcoin to anyone who would arrange for two pizzas to be delivered to his house. That sum would be worth about $200 million today.

Before long, Bitcoin settled into a role in the underground online economy. Seizing on the fact that Bitcoin payments can be harder to trace than online bank transactions, people began using it as payment on the dark web, sometimes for illicit products such as drugs.

In 2014, the online marketplace Silk Road was broken up by the federal government in a highly publicized case. Months later, the major exchange Mt. Gox suffered a breach in which hackers made off with nearly $475 million worth of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s price, which had at one point exceeded $1,000, fell below $400. The cryptocurrency wouldn’t hit four digits again until 2017.

Bitcoin bulls return

Bitcoin’s next bull run began in 2017, coinciding with increased interest in the crypto's underlying blockchain technology.

More merchants began accepting Bitcoin as payment, and many new cryptocurrencies emerged with ideas about how to improve on Bitcoin.

While some of the new crypto endeavors have stuck around, others died out with the hype, which began to recede in 2018 amid increasing regulatory scrutiny. Bitcoin persisted as the most valuable cryptocurrency, but its price, which had approached $20,000, fell below $4,000.

To the moon — and back

Bitcoin roared back in 2021 as government stimulus programs intended to steer the global economy out of the COVID-19 pandemic left consumers flush with cash. Investors poured billions into risky assets such as cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin’s price at one point exceeded $65,000, and its total market capitalization exceeded $1 trillion. But again, the good times wouldn’t last.

Economic policymakers slammed the brakes on easy money to battle inflation. This move led to drawdowns in many investment classes, including stocks. But the collapse of cryptocurrencies was particularly punishing: By fall 2022, Bitcoin was trading around $20,000 — close to where it was at the end of 2020.

Nonetheless, the latest bull run brought in many people who had been skeptical about crypto.

Catherine Valega, a certified financial planner with Green Bee Advisory in Winchester, Massachusetts, says she has seen questions about crypto from clients decline. But the volume of interest in 2021 pushed her to learn enough about Bitcoin that she now believes it can have a place — albeit a small one — in an otherwise diversified portfolio.

“If you are a crypto believer, you sort of think it’s similar to the early days of the internet or the early days of the iPhone,” Valega says. “It remains to be seen how it shakes out, but the technology is pretty incredible.”

The path forward

Aside from the economic factors that have dragged on risky assets in recent months, several factors could affect whether Bitcoin ever approaches the highs encountered in 2021.

Other cryptocurrencies have capabilities Bitcoin doesn’t, and many of them use a more efficient protocol to verify transactions. One of the main criticisms of Bitcoin has centered on the environmental impact of mining, which uses more energy than some countries do.

Regulators around the world are still making sense of the cryptocurrency craze of 2021 and its fallout. It remains to be seen whether governments crack down on cryptocurrency or whether they become more permissive and allow more types of trading.

Bitcoin began during the Great Recession, but there hasn’t been a prolonged economic slowdown in the time Bitcoin has been widely circulating.

Hileman says Bitcoin’s path forward might be hard to predict given the relative lack of historical data about the factors that affect its price.

“Fourteen years. It seems like a long time, but compared to stocks, which have traded for hundreds of years, or bonds, that's a drop in the bucket,” Hileman says.","The blueprint for Bitcoin — real, internet money circulating beyond the reach of banks or governments — hit inboxes Oct. 31, 2008.
Leading financial firms offer Bitcoin in retirement accounts, and some countries use it as legal tender, even as it has suffered devastating losses.
Gox suffered a breach in which hackers made off with nearly $475 million worth of Bitcoin.
More merchants began accepting Bitcoin as payment, and many new cryptocurrencies emerged with ideas about how to improve on Bitcoin.

2022-10-31 09:43:04.175974,CryptoMode,BudBlockz Eyeing Potential 100X Returns in Early 2023 – CryptoMode,"The long-term growth of the crypto market has reached a new low after the recent market drop. As a result, some might bet on the market’s least valued and unpopular coins. Others who want security may go for trust, well-known projects like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have seen significant price hikes throughout the year. However, the new cryptocurrency project BudBlockz (BLUNT), which has already generated 75% returns for its presale investors, holds more promise. As a result, analysts predict further potential 100X returns in early 2023.

What Is BudBlockz?

BudBlockz is the first decentralized online e-commerce for global cannabis enthusiasts. It is solely created to forward the cannabis agenda in the crypto world, giving cannabis enthusiasts a platform to do business safely and securely.

More importantly, people within the BudBlockz ecosystem can do business privately with transparency. $BLUNT, BudBlockz’s native token, is the primary token of trade.

BudBlockz’s native token, $BLUNT, is currently selling at a rapid pace. The price has risen over 75% in the presale, with tokens now trading at $0.030.

Over 44 million $BLUNT tokens have been sold so far, and there is a bullish forecast for BudBlockz, especially since it has a niched yet fast-growing cannabis community.

What’s Fueling Budblockz’s Growth?

First, novelty is on BudBlockz’s side; it is the first decentralized model with a focus on cannabis, a growing global market. BudBlockz will provide a community for all cannabis enthusiasts, regardless of their country’s standing on cannabis use. The platform connects enthusiasts from around the globe.

However, the platform has clarified that the marketplace operates within legal jurisdictions.

Second, the BudBlockz ecosystem provides a private and safe space for the cannabis community. The platform is built on a secure blockchain technology where marijuana sellers and buyers can govern their space.

Third, BudBlockz is planning to push its cannabis ecosystem through innovative developments. Like most cryptos, BudBlockz has an NFT within a decentralized marketplace. It operates with complete transparency and robust security.

Also, the $BLUNT token is liquid within the BudBlockz network — it can be used to trade NFTs, buy and sell products, and users can earn rewards through decentralized finance (DeFi) and P2E (Play to Earn) gaming.

BudBlockz works like other cryptocurrencies but completely focuses on the cannabis trade. The following are some of BudBlockz’s features:

Cannabis Dispensaries

BudBlockz aims to open dispensaries in countries and states where cannabis use is legal. Users and buyers can purchase products using the $BLUNT token.

Ecommerce

Cannabis enthusiasts within cannabis-friendly areas can access BudBlockz products through its online store.

BLUNT Rewards

Users will accumulate more rewards the more they use $BLUNT.

NFT Marketplace

BudBlockz NFTs have a unique value system that will be linked to dispensaries, fractional farms, or product ownership.

Conclusion

As the cannabis industry embarks on a new journey of digital transactions and decentralized finance, BudBlockz is primed to become a one-of-a-kind platform to facilitate marijuana buyers, sellers, and businesses soon.

And its ongoing presale stage is the perfect opportunity for you to get involved with a token many analysts have predicted to make 100X profits by Early 2023.

Polygon (MATIC): Built by Developers, for Developers Indeed!

Polygon, which was established in 2017, is a “layer 2” or “sidechain” scaling technology that works in tandem with the Ethereum blockchain to provide quick transactions and minimal fees. The Polygon platform is powered by the Ethereum blockchain, which enables developers to create on a big scale without fretting about expensive gas costs. Instead, a sidechain like this one enables users to do smaller transactions that would otherwise be infeasible on the Ethereum network.

By adopting the Polygon platform, a blockchain project can become more flexible and scalable without sacrificing the security, interoperability, and architectural advantages of the Ethereum network. For its chain, Polygon employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus process. Users must invest their MATIC tokens as proof of their commitment to the Polygon Network’s consensus process in order to participate.

At the time of press, Polygon’s total circulating stock was worth $7,441,499,126.62, and MATIC’s market capitalization was still $6,216,649,659. Polygon is now trading at $0.83 after moving 5.83% in the last week.

Stellar (XLM): A Goal to Be Easier, Faster, and Cheaper Globally

Stellar is a decentralised peer-to-peer (P2P) network that was developed in 2014 by Stellar.org. The network’s goal is to link the world’s financial systems and guarantee a protocol for payment processors and financial institutions. It was formally established in 2015. The platform is designed to move money rapidly, inexpensively, and dependably.

XLM is the network’s native digital currency, acting as a gateway currency for activities in addition to being utilized to pay transaction fees. The current XLM price as of writing this post is $0.110806, with a $53,729,231 24-hour trading volume.

Orbeon Protocol (ORBN): Worthy Venture for Early Investors

The Orbeon Protocol platform is reinventing the venture capital and crowdfunding industries by allowing anybody to make fractional investments into some of the most innovative and interesting startup firms.

Orbeon Protocol is fast becoming a well known name in the cryptocurrency industry since it is disrupting the venture capital industry and is offering everyday investors with the opportunity to invest in the next tech unicorn. For decades only venture capitalists have had access to the world’s most promising startups. However Orbeon Protocol is here to change that by utilising fractionalised NFTs and allowing investors to buy into the most promising projects for as little as $1.

The ORBN utility token is the native currency of Orbeon Protocol and offers the Orbeon community a host of perks. This includes governance and voting rights, priority access to upcoming funding rounds, discounts on trading and transaction fees, staking bonuses, rewards and access to exclusive investor groups.

The total supply of ORBN is 888,000,000. Only 40% of the total supply of ORBN is available at a starting price of $0.004 to the public for presale. Based on current demand and interest in the token, investors can expect a 6,000% increase in the presale price of ORBN to $0.24.

$THE token listing was supported by Gate's startup feature through an airdrop campaign of $100,000 value on the 25th of October.

Participation in the “Startup Sale” was open for users starting from VIP-0 level and a minimum amount of $500 value in assets. VIP-0 level users were offered a contribution share equal to 1/4 of the allocation for VIP-1 level users. Program is using a distribution model where the higher the VIP level, the higher the contributor’s share. A single Gate user was limited to 1000 shares.

At the beginning of the Sale, the valuation of $THE protocol was $0 with 9,723,190 total supply for $THE tokens. During the 17 hours of Sale THE Protocol raised nearly $50M from 15 916 investors. 10% of $THE token supply was allocated to Vitalik Buterin for its contribution, continuous support and inspiration of THE Protocol.

Gate.io exchange, one of the world’s largest and oldest cryptocurrency exchanges, has announced the $THE/$USDT pair available for trading starting at 10.00 a.m (UTC) October, 26.

$THE token listing on other major centralized exchanges

As of October 18, THE protocol emerged as the leading token based on its features, which included zero-tax, burned liquidity, and a renounced contract, which is more related to the theme of decentralization. As of October 20, major centralized exchanges such as MEXC, LBank, and Hotbit had already listed $THE. Centralized exchange listings benefit $THE by storing liquidity for the token to be traded on their platforms. Furthermore, these listings lend legitimacy to $THE's credibility and make $THE more accessible to retail traders.

$THE is also available on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and Sushiswap.

About THE Protocol

THE Protocol was inspired by a Twitter post of Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum and has received much attention on social media.



Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, tweeted at the DeFi Community on October 14, 2022. He joked about naming a token ""THE"" in the tweet. Several DeFi developers launched projects across different chains immediately after the tweet. As of October 18, twenty-five contracts were deployed across the Ethereum and BSC Blockchains. THE protocol emerged as the leading token based on its features, which included zero-tax, burned liquidity, and a renounced contract, which is more related to the theme of decentralization and a reflection of Vitalik's vision for the crypto space.

$THE received over 85k Twitter mentions in less than 24 hours, and some of the most influential names in the crypto twitter space have openly expressed their support for the coin.

2022-10-31 09:43:04.562917,Investing.com,Crypto Analyst Shares Analysis for 4 Altcoin Trade Opportunities By CoinEdition,"Crypto Analyst Shares Analysis for 4 Altcoin Trade Opportunities

BTC/USD -0.09% Add to/Remove from Watchlist ETH/USD +1.11% Add to/Remove from Watchlist ADA/USD 0% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Michaël van de Poppe shares his technical analysis for RSR, LINK, ADA and QNT.

ADA is a massive long-term buy opportunity, according to the analyst.

He adds that RSR could drop to as low as $0.0055.

The global crypto market cap is down 1.82% over the last 24 hours according to the crypto market tracking website, CoinMarketCap. Despite this, the total crypto market cap maintains its position above the $1 trillion mark.

Quant (QNT)

Quant (QNT) is up 3.08% over the last 24 hours – boosting its price up to $167.57. In addition, QNT’s price has strengthened against (BTC) and (ETH) by 5.06% and 6.09% respectively.

The crypto trader, Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) tweeted his technical analysis on QNT yesterday evening. According to the crypto analyst, there is a potential bounce play on the cards for QNT.

QNT’s price is currently trading near the support of the previous bounce play, leaving two scenarios that can play out. Either the price of QNT rebounds back up or it will drop to $140 where the next play will happen.

Chainlink (LINK)

The price of LINK is trading at $7.92 after a 24-hour gain of 2.31%. LINK has also strengthened against BTC and ETH by 4.28% and 5.35% respectively.

Daily chart for LINK/USDT (Source: Twitter)

According to the crypto analyst, the current Risk/Reward Ratio that traders should adopt for a LINK long position is around 4.04%. The ultimate target for a long position on LINK is 26.23%.

Reserve Rights (RSR)

RSR is trading at $0.006221 and was unable to follow the trend seen with LINK and QNT, as its price has slipped 3.30% over the last 24 hours. Furthermore, its price weakened against BTC and ETH by 1.59% and 0.54% respectively.

Michaël van de Poppe suggests entering a long position at $0.0055 or when RSR’s price is able to flip the resistance level at $0.007 into support. Given the current price drop of RSR over the last 24 hours, it may be best to wait for RSR’s price to drop lower to $0.0055.

(ADA)

ADA is currently trading at $0.4016 after its price decreased 4.35% over the last day. Similar to RSR, ADA’s price has weakened against BTC and ETH by 2.48% and 1.34% respectively.

The crypto analyst believes that there is a long-term, massive buy opportunity present for ADA investors currently. He goes as far to add that ADA’s current price may be hovering at its low for this current bear market.

,Cryptopolitan,Polkadex has released the Polkadex Orderbook decentralized exchange,"Just over a year after the launch of the Polkadex mainnet, Polkadex Orderbook is now open for trading. The revolutionary orderbook-based decentralized exchange (DEX) is set to be a game-changer for digital asset trading and DeFi.

In the last few years, DEXs like Uniswap have changed the way in which cryptocurrency is traded by giving traders control over their own funds. However, the automated market maker (AMM) model popularized by such DEXs has been plagued with exorbitant transaction fees, price slippage, frontrunning, low interoperability, and limited functionality. While it may be riskier due to potential hacks and data breaches, many crypto traders still prefer to use the advanced trading features of centralized exchanges (CEXs), which are cheaper to use and offer high levels of functionality and interoperability.

“This is the first time an orderbook is connected to two leading ecosystems, Ethereum and Polkadot directly. We will continue to evolve as a cross-chain DEX connected to all leading ecosystems and sourcing native liquidity from BTC, XRP, MATIC, etc.” said Gautham J, CEO and Co-Founder of Polkadex.

Polkadex Orderbook’s cutting-edge architecture means that while it may look, feel, and perform like a centralized exchange (CEX), it remains non-custodial and preserves the security aspect of DEXs. A unique combination of blockchain and trusted execution environment (TEE) technology, Polkadex Orderbook is not only the first project to use the Substrate Abstraction Layer for SGX technology to build a decentralized exchange, but it is also one of the first retail use cases of this technology in general.



With the decentralized security of a layer 2 DEX built on top of the Polkadex network, and a sleek CEX-like interface containing advanced trading features (including limit and market orders), Polkadex Orderbook elegantly bridges the gap between centralized and decentralized trading. Built to be capable of scaling to high frequency trading, Polkadex Orderbook is as fast–if not faster than–existing CEXs.

“We will continue to position our DEX to empower the global trading community and drive towards a paradigm shift in being the torchbearer for trustlessness”, said Deepansh Singh, COO and Co-Founder of Polkadex.

While this release is the culmination of almost two years of work, it is only the beginning of what Polkadex has set out to accomplish. Currently, Polkadex Orderbook will only be supporting one trading pair, PDEX/USDT, with USDT being bridged over from Ethereum through ChainBridge. After a bug bounty program with the aim of further securing the platform, the Polkadex team will start ramping up support for more trading pairs with v2.0 coming within the next six months.

In the future, Polkadex will replace ChainBridge with its own tailored decentralized bridging mechanism, THEA, which will allow deposits and withdrawals from Ethereum to Polkadex and vice versa. THEA is set to add support for other Layer 1 networks down the line. Also, after having won a Polkadot parachain slot in May, Polkadex will soon connect its parachain to the Polkadex network and pave the way for assets from across the Polkadot parachain ecosystems to be tradeable. Both THEA and the Polkadex parachain will allow Polkadex Orderbook to become the first interoperable non-custodial exchange capable of high frequency trading.

“We are trying to bridge the gap between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0. This is the first time an application-specific blockchain is designed from the ground up for an actual use case. Polkadex will be pioneering a new era in blockchain economics,” said Vivek Prasannan, Executive Director and Co-Founder of Polkadex.
